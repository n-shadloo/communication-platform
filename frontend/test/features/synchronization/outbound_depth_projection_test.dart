/// What the delivery supervisor is watching, and what a local echo does to it.
///
/// Sending is not a call into the supervisor: a composer writes a durable row
/// and returns, and the row is the request (ADR-060). Local echo changes which
/// row that is — the ciphertext no longer exists at the moment of the send — so
/// this depth has to count what is owed as well as what is sealed, or a message
/// would sit in storage until something unrelated happened to wake the engine.
///
/// It also has to count *operations* rather than rows. The supervisor reacts to
/// growth, and a send that seals three envelopes has not become three new
/// sends: counting rows would ask for a cycle that arrives to find the work it
/// was told about already done, having paid a drain to discover it.
