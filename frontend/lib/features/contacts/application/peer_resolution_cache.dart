/// How long one server answer about a peer may stand in for a fresh one.

/// Thirty seconds is the span of one delivery cycle, which is the only thing
/// this cache is for. Every redundant resolution the phase is about is inside
/// one: a preparation's peer lookup, its own-account lookup and the
/// re-resolution a prekey claim performs are consecutive, and the device-log
/// gossip the same cycle owes that peer is separated from them by one outbox
/// flush and one inbox pass. Ten seconds covers the first three and loses the
/// fourth on any device with a mailbox; a minute would start joining
/// *different* cycles, which nothing asked for and nothing invalidates.
///
/// What it costs is bounded and stated. A peer device revoked or added with no
/// local signal whatsoever — no `stale_devices` response, no envelope from the
/// new device, no trust transition, no user action — is invisible for at most
/// thirty seconds longer than it already was. That is small beside the window
/// that already exists between sealing a ciphertext and delivering it, which
/// the outbox's own backoff measures in minutes, and it is far below the
/// fifteen-minute floor at which the platform can wake this process at all, so
/// no entry can survive from one background catch-up to the next.

/// produce is one the server itself returned inside [ttl].
///
/// **A prekey claim is not part of it.** `claimPrekeyBundles` consumes
