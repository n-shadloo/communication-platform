/// The body of the one security notice, shared by the mandatory enrollment
/// step, by the one-time re-presentation, and by every place the notice is
/// re-opened.
///
/// There is exactly one copy of this content. Before ADR-045 the enrollment
/// gate and the pre-login link rendered two different notices under two
/// different titles, so what a user was required to acknowledge and what a user
/// could go back and re-read were not the same statement.
///
/// The first two sections are permanent: they describe the protocol's threat
/// boundary and stay true in a production release. They therefore name no
/// feature — ADR-052 removed "files" and "voice audio" from the first, because
/// the artifact carrying that sentence can send neither, and a permanent
/// section that enumerates capabilities goes stale every time the feature set
/// does. The third describes the build that is running and appears only in a
/// build that is handed to someone else, so temporary wording cannot survive
/// into a release that no longer deserves it.
