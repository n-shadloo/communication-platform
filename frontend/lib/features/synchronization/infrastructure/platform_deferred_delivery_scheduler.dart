/// a periodic job and to say whether a headless catch-up currently owns
/// delivery; the platform asks Dart to run one catch-up now and waits for the
/// answer. There is no payload in either direction beyond an interval in
/// milliseconds, so an entry point reached this way carries nothing a hostile
/// caller could shape.
///
/// The reply to `runCatchUp` is the load-bearing part. The platform holds a
/// wake lock for the duration of the job and lets the process be frozen again
/// once the job is finished, so a reply sent before the drain has finished ends
/// the catch-up mid-flight. This adapter therefore does not answer until the
/// delivery owner acknowledges the tick — or until [tickDeadline] passes, which
/// keeps a stalled owner from holding the wake-up open until the platform's own
/// deadline kills the process.
