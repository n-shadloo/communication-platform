/// The release gate for ADR-051's opt-in sustained delivery: the capability may
/// not be offered to a user until it has been measured on the phones that user
/// actually has.
///
/// ## Why this exists
///
/// Sustained delivery rests on two things the platform *permits* and never
/// *guarantees* — that a foreground service keeps running, and that an exempt
/// app keeps its network through Doze — and on a third thing the platform does
/// not govern at all: whether the manufacturer of the phone leaves the process
/// alone. Roughly nine in ten Android devices in this deployment's country are
/// made by two manufacturers whose own documentation says they suspend
/// background applications on their own schedule. None of that is knowable from
/// documentation, from source, or from a host test. It is knowable only by
/// measurement, and no measurement has been made.
///
/// ADR-046 held that this layer may not be enabled in a distributed artifact
/// before that matrix had been run. ADR-051 removed that clause on the argument
/// that the matrix could not be run in the environment available, so keeping it
/// would cancel the capability rather than defer it. ADR-053 restores it, on the
/// ground that "we cannot measure this" is a reason to withhold a capability
/// from users, never a reason to ship it: the cost of being wrong is a person
/// who was told their messages would arrive and did not get them.
///
/// ## What kind of gate this is
///
/// There is deliberately no environment define, no remote value, no runtime
/// setter and no debug override. Opening this gate means editing this file to
/// add [SustainedDeliveryFieldEvidence] for every mandatory
/// [SustainedDeliveryFleetCell], and each record has to survive
/// [SustainedDeliveryFieldEvidence.isAdmissible] — which refuses an emulator,
/// refuses a run shorter than the criteria require, and refuses a cell that was
/// reasoned about rather than run. An inadmissible record does not open
/// anything; it is simply not counted.
///
/// The criteria, the matrix, the measurement procedure and the current results
/// are in `docs/sustained-delivery-validation.md`.
/// `test/architecture/sustained_delivery_gate_test.dart` fails if this gate
/// opens without them.
