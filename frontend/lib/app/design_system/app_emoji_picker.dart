/// The application's only import of `package:emoji_picker_flutter` (ADR-059).
///
/// Feature screens use this component and `showAppEmojiPicker`; the package
/// name does not appear outside this file, on the same rule Forui follows under
/// ADR-006. Two settings below are properties of the application rather than of
/// any screen, so they are decided here and not at a call site:
///
///   * `recentTabBehavior` is `NONE` and `SkinToneConfig.rememberSkinTone`
///     stays at its default `false`. Those two flags guard every
///     `shared_preferences` call the package makes -
///     `EmojiPickerState._onEmojiSelected` reaches `addEmojiToRecentlyUsed` /
///     `addEmojiToPopularUsed` only under `RECENT` / `POPULAR`, and the skin
///     tone is read and written only when it is remembered - so with both off
///     the picker writes nothing to disk. That is deliberate: everything else
///     this application knows about a person is in SQLCipher under a
///     Keystore-wrapped key, and a plaintext list of the emoji they most
///     recently used would be a durable record of their behaviour sitting
///     outside that boundary.
///   * `Config.emojiTextStyle` is left unset, which is the only place a font
///     family could be named, so glyphs are drawn with the platform emoji font.
///     Nothing is fetched, and no font is bundled.
///
/// `checkPlatformCompatibility` is left on. On Android it asks the platform,
/// over the package's one method channel, which glyphs the device font can
/// actually draw, and drops the rest - which is the difference between a grid
/// of emoji and a grid with tofu in it. The call is answered by
/// `PaintCompat.hasGlyph` from `androidx.core`, which this module already
/// adopts at 1.16.0 under ADR-054. Off Android the package short-circuits
/// before the channel, so a widget test on this workstation never reaches it.
