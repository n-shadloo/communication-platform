# Backend and Flutter implementation checklist

This is the live delivery checklist. Backend checkmarks mean an API/capability exists and
is documented, not that the Flutter integration exists. Flutter documentation is now
specified; pieces 01–06 provide the Android foundation and a preserved post-v1 Web
scaffold, architecture skeleton, app-owned design system, responsive routed shell,
guarded bootstrap, secure local storage, and typed REST/authentication/WebSocket
transport foundation. Later capabilities remain pending. Piece 07 now provides the
shared Rust primitive foundation and Android FFI/isolate adapter; Web/Wasm crypto is
post-v1, explicitly deferred, and remains fail-closed. Piece 12 provides the crash-safe
opaque inbox/outbox synchronization engine and lifecycle foundation, piece 13 provides
the pairwise transport, and piece 14 now provides the application-message protocol,
conversation domain, and local projections. Completion and test evidence are recorded
below only after verification.

Legend: **Ready** = implemented backend contract; **Client protocol** = intentionally
opaque/client-owned; **Pending** = Flutter implementation not started.

## Foundation

| Capability | Backend | Flutter |
|---|---|---|
| Health/reachability | Ready: `/api/v1/health` | Pieces 04/06 typed single-origin state machine and bounded Dio health adapter complete; provisioned staging trust integration remains a release gate |
| Private CA/TLS deployment | Ready | Piece 04 Android network-security template, CA/primary+backup-pin interfaces, and blocking failures complete; the preserved Web external-trust model is post-v1; provisioned-device staging integration remains pending |
| Android project | Not applicable | Piece 01 scaffold complete; development/production Android flavors compile; the preserved Web entry point is post-v1 |
| Architecture and protocol docs | Backend docs ready | Piece 02 feature-first Clean Architecture skeleton compiled with sealed typed failures, scoped Riverpod composition, and source-layout/inward-dependency tests; normative fixtures/security gates pending |
| CI/reproducible offline builds | Backend ready | Local CI commands, SDK pin, and lockfile ready; isolated offline-cache rehearsal pending |
| Redacted diagnostics | Backend ready | Piece 06 typed payload-free network diagnostic events and redaction tests complete; user-initiated local export remains piece 21 |
| Shared Rust crypto core | Client protocol | Piece 07 Android foundation complete: pinned primitive providers, zeroizing secret types, bounded deterministic CBOR, stable ABI/status codes, panic containment, dedicated isolate, three-ABI packaging, and packaged Android smoke pass; Web/Wasm and later protocols remain pending |

## Accounts and devices

| Capability | Backend | Flutter |
|---|---|---|
| Register/manual activation | Ready | Piece 09 account registration, pending-activation state, localized validation/errors, and responsive screens complete; activation remains owner-driven with no polling |
| Login/refresh/logout | Ready | Piece 09 authentication plus piece 10 full-scope enrollment handoff, incomplete-secure-setup restoration/guards, and final messaging release complete |
| User directory | Ready | Piece 11 activated-user fetch, atomic Drift cache, offline presentation, bounded local paging/search, and Contacts/New UI complete |
| Encrypted profile blob | Ready opaque storage | Piece 11 authenticated fetch/publish, version retry, cached fallback gating, and profile-key distribution ports complete; development fake transport is explicitly non-production and every other flavor resolves the unsupported adapters, so publishing and peer profile decryption fail closed. `profilePublishingProvider` reads that from the composed adapters and Edit Profile states it and disables Save (ADR-045, correcting ADR-044's supported tier) |
| Cross-signing identity publish/fetch | Ready opaque transport | Pieces 10/11 complete local identity lifecycle plus exact peer `master_sig` verification, persisted user-signing attestation, key-change blocking, and profile/Safety Number UI |
| Register/list/label/revoke devices | Ready; two-phase enrollment contract | Pieces 10/17 complete enrollment plus authenticated own-device ETag listing, account-private encrypted labels, relabel, explicit remote/self revocation, crash-resumable log-first removal, secure self cleanup, and Linked Devices UI |
| Peer device lists, ETags, signed device log | Ready opaque transport | Pieces 10/11/17 complete authenticated own/peer device sets, canonical signed-log verification and extension, exact predicted-sequence confirmation, concurrent append recovery, encrypted pairwise head gossip, and persistent global fork/equivocation blocking |
| Hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM prekeys | Ready public distribution | Pending reviewed PQXDH core; no classical fallback |
| PQ MLS key packages | 4096/16384 buckets + last-resort ready | Candidate selected; blocked on the unassigned MLS suite identifier, the hybrid KEM's expiring draft reference, maintained OpenMLS/provider support, vectors, and review |
| SAS/QR master-key verification | Client protocol | Piece 11 exact-two-master-key SAS/QR, explicit out-of-band confirmation, user-signing attestation, and persistent verified/change states complete; messaging remains withheld on every non-verified state |
| Recovery onboarding | Identity backup API ready | Piece 10 one-time checksummed secret, Rust Argon2id/XChaCha backup, first upload, later restore, wrong-secret handling, and honest no-history notice complete |

## Messaging

| Capability | Backend | Flutter |
|---|---|---|
| Per-device durable envelope queue | Ready | Piece 12 durable Drift inbox/outbox journals, opaque event deduplication, bounded queues, and process-death recovery plus piece 14 atomic application-event markers/projections complete |
| Batched fan-out/stale devices | Ready | Piece 12 UUID-byte-sorted <=256 target batches, exact-ciphertext retry, partial progress, stale terminal state/session invalidation, and durable refresh requests complete |
| Drain/ack | Ready | Piece 12 authoritative REST paging, duplicate/reorder handling, post-commit idempotent ack, and durable contiguous checkpoint complete |
| Seven-day TTL / `pruned_through` gaps | Ready signal | Piece 12 pre-processing comparison, blocking queue-gap/group recovery state, retained MLS-dependent opaque envelopes, and recovered loss-baseline transition complete; fresh Welcome production flow remains gated on MLS pieces |
| WebSocket live delivery | Ready | Piece 06 authenticated gateway/close-code mapping and piece 12 lifecycle supervisor complete, with socket envelopes treated as wake-up hints that always trigger an authoritative REST drain. **Composed 2026-08-21 (ADR-047)**, closing ADR-046 follow-up step 1: `MessageDeliveryController` starts one session per device-bound full session, the socket is built from the one `NetworkingFoundation` that `AuthenticationAssembly` owns, and a composition test drives the real controller, session, supervisor, engine, store, gateway and coordinator against a fake transport. On-device the provisioned beta build clears the fail-closed gate against the live backend; a signed-in socket has not been observed on a device, because reaching full scope needs an account the server owner activates by hand |
| DM identity/session | Client protocol | Piece 13 hybrid PQXDH/Double Ratchet transport and exact pairwise fan-out/outbox integration complete |
| Text messages | Client protocol | Pieces 14–15 complete deterministic-CBOR events, typed projections, honest optimistic transport state, Riverpod streams, and the production app-owned timeline |
| Replies/edits/deletes | Client protocol | Piece 14 reply references, deterministic revision winner, authorization, local tombstone, best-effort remote-delete, and attachment-cache cleanup complete |
| Reactions/pins/receipts | Client protocol | Piece 14 idempotent set projections, participant/role authorization, per-device receipt provenance, durable delivered work, and privacy-gated read sends complete |
| Typing/presence meaning | Volatile relay ready | Piece 14 bounded volatile typing expiry, conservative socket presence, disconnect clearing, and typed Riverpod streams complete; signals never enter durable projections |
| Private contact blocking | No server ACL by design | Protocol specified; implementation pending |
| Multi-device self-sync/history | Ready device-to-device; no history API | Pieces 14/17 complete ordinary own-device fan-out plus authenticated, bounded, resumable history batches over exact-recipient hybrid pairwise envelopes with transactional deduplication and honest partial/no-source recovery states |
| Saved Messages | Client protocol | Pieces 14–15 complete the domain-separated local conversation, own-account authorization, unread-free/local-only behavior, no peer presence/receipt promise, routing, timeline, composer, and actions |
| Local search | No plaintext server search by design | Pending Android encrypted index |

## Groups

| Capability | Backend | Flutter |
|---|---|---|
| Key-package claim | Ready | Piece 19 has real closed-beta generation, replenishment, consumable claim, and separately uploaded last-resort lifecycle wiring; backend bucket/consumption contract execution remains pending and production upload is disabled |
| Group ciphertext delivery | Envelope transport ready | Piece 19 routes every closed-beta MLS object through durable recipient-bound Double Ratchet fan-out, including own other devices, with exact ciphertext retry. The commit-to-network leg is covered by crash and transaction-failure injection against the real repository, outbox, and fan-out coordinator (2026-08-18), which found and fixed two defects: one logical send identity per group object collided with the durable outbox's unique event id, so any group with two or more remote members committed its epoch and could never transmit it on any retry, and a single unroutable operation stranded every later group behind it. Execution against the packaged Rust core and physical devices remains pending; production remains disabled. **That pending item is now the condition ADR-055 puts in front of the surface reaching a user at all**, measured by `tool/measure_beta_mls_core.sh` |
| Group availability by build | Client protocol | ADR-044: one source-only `GroupProductionGate.privateExperimentalPermit` decides both the closed-beta stack and its screens. Before it, `groupFeatureAvailabilityProvider` read the development-preview permit alone, which requires `!kReleaseMode`, so every group screen in the shipped Beta release rendered the closed gate while that same artifact composed `NativeBetaGroupMls`, ran `GroupKeyPackageMaintenanceService` as post-inbox work, and processed inbound group objects - uploading MLS KeyPackages for groups no user of it could create. Screens now gate on `GroupFeatureAvailability.isAvailable` rather than naming one tier, and the group banner states what the running build's stack actually is: the development preview says it transmits nothing, the Private Experimental build says the encryption is experimental and an update may reset the group and delete its messages. Production is unchanged and still resolves `UnsupportedGroupMlsCrypto`. Covered by three architecture tests and one widget test. **Withheld 2026-08-24 (ADR-055).** Re-deciding the exposure on evidence rather than on ADR-044's conclusion found the group *logic* well evidenced and its *execution* evidenced nowhere: `cp_crypto_v1_beta_mls_operation` has never run on any physical device or emulator, on any ABI, on any date, which five rows of this checklist and `mls-beta-review-readiness.md` already recorded. The `beta` Cargo profile is the only one linking `aws-lc-sys` - C and assembly cross-compiled per ABI - and the C ABI's `catch_unwind` contains a Rust panic but not a fault below Rust, which would take the supported direct-message tier down with it. `integration_test/crypto_core_android_smoke_test.dart` covers the fifteen foundation symbols and never reaches the beta symbol, and `tool/ci.sh` does not run `integration_test` at all. The permit now requires the beta environment **and** an admissible record in `GroupExperimentalGate` for every mandatory ABI (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`; `x86_64` is non-mandatory because an emulated record is inadmissible and no recipient has x86 hardware). The ledger is **empty**, so the distributed artifact resolves `UnsupportedGroupMlsCrypto` on all nine port methods, `groupKeyPackageMaintenanceServiceProvider` throws so **no KeyPackage is generated or uploaded and the device advertises no group capability**, the durable sync engine composes no KeyPackage post-inbox work, the inbound coordinator refuses group objects rather than processing them, every group screen renders the closed gate, and the Contacts entry point is disabled and labelled rather than routing to a refusal. Withheld and production-unavailable are distinct states with distinct wording, because only one of them is waiting on evidence. **Nothing is unwired**: ADR-036, ADR-037, ADR-039, ADR-040 and ADR-041 are untouched and every one of their tests still runs - this is a gate, not a removal, and `tool/measure_beta_mls_core.sh` is the instrument that opens it, cross-compiling the crate's own `--features beta-pq-mls` test binary for one ABI and running it on-device with nothing added to the application. It exits non-zero with no device attached, which is what it did here. A real defect was found and fixed on the way: `CreateGroupPage`, `GroupChatPage` and `GroupInfoPage` each checked their injected-collaborator path **before** the availability gate, so a caller supplying its own collaborators rendered the flow in a build with no group stack; the gate is now first on all five routed screens and a test pins the ordering. Disclosure moves 5 → 6: the statement had been telling readers that group chats use experimental encryption and can be reset, which in an artifact with no group stack describes a feature they do not have. Production is untouched and provably so - a test asserts that even a fully satisfied ledger leaves production holding no permit. Covered by 20 gate assertions plus the updated screen, contacts and disclosure tests. **Reopened on one measured ABI 2026-08-24 (ADR-056).** A Samsung Galaxy A56 (SM-A566B, Android 16, API 36, retail `user` build, `release-keys`) became available, so the one outstanding item was run instead of argued about: `tool/measure_beta_mls_core.sh arm64-v8a` cross-compiled the crate's own `--features beta-pq-mls` test binary with the pinned toolchain, pushed it to the phone and ran it there - **128 passed, 0 failed, 3 ignored in 172.07 s**, the *same* counts `cargo test --locked --all-features` gives on the x86_64 host, so the device ran the whole suite rather than a subset that linked. Forty `mls_beta::` tests ran, including the create/join/private-message/proposal/commit/remove round trip and `suite_signs_with_ed25519_and_round_trips_hybrid_hpke`, which is where `aws-lc`'s ML-KEM runs. Hardware exposed two defects in the instrument, both fixed and neither findable another way: MSYS rewrote `adb push … /data/local/tmp/…` into `C:/Program Files/Git/data/…` so the first run died on `remote secure_mkdirs() failed`, and the three setup lines sent stdout to `/dev/null` while `adb shell` folds remote stderr into stdout, so that failure printed nothing at all. The A56 reports an **empty `abilist32`** - its Exynos s5e8855 is 64-bit-only - so `armeabi-v7a` cannot be measured on the hardware that measured `arm64-v8a`. Rather than demote a cell for being unmeasurable (the move ADR-053 exists to forbid and ADR-055 pre-refused) or withhold from everyone over a device nobody here has, the *question* became per-ABI: `GroupExperimentalGate.hasEvidenceFor(Abi)` replaces the global `isOpen`, the permit takes the running ABI from `runtimeAbiProvider`, and one APK's three libraries get three answers. `arm64-v8a` is open; `armeabi-v7a` and `x86_64` stay withheld in substance and `armeabi-v7a` stays in the ledger recorded as unmeasured. This is **stricter** than ADR-055 where it matters: a satisfied ledger would previously have opened every ABI including one added later with no run, whereas an unmeasured ABI is now withheld whatever the ledger holds and an unpackaged ABI maps to no cell and fails closed. The ABI is read, never chosen - `Abi.current()` is fixed by the loaded AOT snapshot, reaches the app through one seam a test asserts is the only caller, can only narrow, and cannot reach production. Disclosure moves 6 → 7: the point now carries ADR-036's disposable-state rule *and* the fact that an unmeasured processor is withheld the feature, because it has to be true for a reader on either kind of phone. Production re-verified by rebuild plus `verify_release_apk.sh --production` (7/7), and a test asserts a full ledger still leaves production holding no permit on any ABI. Covered by 25 gate assertions |
| Group creation/membership | Client protocol | Piece 19 implements real closed-beta create, authenticated later Welcome/re-add, membership controls, opaque state, and piece-18 CAS storage. The device-local crash and transaction-failure matrix over that CAS boundary is implemented and passing on 2026-08-18: 39 tests abort one exact statement inside the real transaction at every write in the unit, outbound and inbound, and assert the whole unit is absent; a simulated process restart reopens the durable file, passes `PRAGMA quick_check`, and finishes or discards the interrupted operation. The physical-device half — process kill, Doze, force-stop, torn writes, Keystore after reboot, packaged Rust core — has not been run. Remaining recovery/concurrency matrices keep production fail-closed |
| Owner/admin/member roles | Client protocol | Piece 19 signs and verifies deterministic controls with device authentication proofs and replays the authenticated transcript; full adversarial/device matrix and independent review remain pending |
| Invite/remove/leave | Client protocol | Closed-beta Invite/re-add, remove, and ADR-039 two-phase leave with automatic owner-side eviction are integrated. The queue-gap remove/re-add matrix is implemented and tested on 2026-08-18: an evicted member is re-admissible by a fresh Add against newly claimed KeyPackages, while a live member and one whose eviction is still uncommitted stay refused; a blocked device admits an authenticated re-admission Welcome and nothing else, requires a consumed KeyPackage and a strictly forward revision, and replaces the retained group, roster, and transcript in the same transaction that retires the group's obligation, advances the acknowledged loss baseline through `pruned_through`, and releases the retained MLS-blocked envelopes. Covered by 45 Dart tests across three files (11 domain re-admission, 31 device-side recovery matrix, 3 admission-service re-invite), including compare-and-swap abort, rollback of the pairwise receive, multi-group blocking, explicit local abandonment, and restart-mid-recovery resumability, against a scripted crypto port. The peer-to-peer signal that asks peers to remove and re-add a gapped device has no defined wire format in either the backend or frontend contract and is not implemented; recovery is driven by the re-admission itself. Execution against the real crypto core, a running backend, and multiple physical devices remains pending, and production MLS commits remain gated |
| Encrypted metadata | Opaque envelope transport ready | Closed beta processes metadata/policy controls inside authenticated MLS transport and the atomic state/projection boundary; production remains gated |
| History for new members | Envelope transport ready; no server history | Policy and authenticated Welcome are integrated; bounded cryptographic history re-share validation remains pending and never implies server history |
| Fork/conflict handling | Client protocol | ADR-041 canonical same-revision convergence is implemented and tested: siblings are authenticated and replayed against the shared parent, and the winner is decided by operation precedence class, then the signer's authority in that parent, then the authenticated signer identity, so no branch author can bias the outcome; a superseded branch fork-quarantines atomically for remove/re-add. ADR-038's hash-only order was superseded on 2026-08-17 after the hash was measured to be author-grindable at about 24,500 candidate branches per second per core. Covered by a Rust grinding measurement and 32 Dart tests, including an adversarial sweep over every role and invitation policy. Multi-device execution against the real crypto core remains pending |
| Leave coordination | Client protocol | ADR-039 two-phase departure is implemented and tested: the leaver signs a non-membership announcement at the current epoch and the active owner automatically commits the `Remove` that evicts the leaves. Covered by a Rust descriptor test and 16 Dart tests; multi-device execution against real devices remains pending |

## Attachments and recovery

| Capability | Backend | Flutter |
|---|---|---|
| Bucketed encrypted upload/download | Ready | Pending secretstream pipeline. `AttachmentTransferService` exists but is composed by no provider, `pubspec.yaml` declares no picker, and the composer's sheet now says attachments are not built rather than offering inert choices (ADR-045, correcting ADR-044's supported tier) |
| Quota and TTL | Ready | Pending UI/error handling |
| Encrypted attachment metadata/key | Client protocol | Pending |
| Bounded secure cache | Not applicable | Pending |
| Key backup blob | Ready for cross-signing identity material | Piece 10 4,096-byte Rust Argon2id/XChaCha20-Poly1305 format, parameter/bucket validation, stale-version reconciliation, and cleanup complete |
| Server history | Deliberately absent | Piece 17 transfers only locally held application-event history between cross-signing-authorized online devices; no history/archive endpoint or server-history dependency exists |
| New-device restore | Two-phase enrollment and identity backup APIs ready | Pieces 10/17 complete identity restore/cross-sign/log follow-up and honest device-to-device full/partial history recovery without transferring ratchets, MLS epochs, archive keys, or server history |

## Voice rooms and realtime

| Capability | Backend | Flutter |
|---|---|---|
| Create/read/rename room | Ready opaque name | Pending |
| Room live count/signals | Ready volatile relay | Pending |
| LiveKit token | Ready | Pending join/reconnect client |
| Self-hosted LiveKit/TURN | Deployment ready | Pending integration tests |
| Room invitations/membership | Client protocol | Leave semantics specified; implementation pending |
| Audio E2EE/key distribution | Server deliberately excluded | Pending MLS exporter/E2EE gate |
| Ephemeral room text | Volatile relay ready | Pending encrypted memory-only UI |
| Android active-call service | Not applicable | Pending |
| Web E2EE worker | Not applicable | Post-v1 backlog; not part of the Android release |

## UI

| Capability | Backend | Flutter |
|---|---|---|
| Responsive shell | Not applicable | Pieces 03â€“04 adaptive `go_router` shell plus guarded Splash/Connection bootstrap routing complete; stable branch identity, deep-link placeholders, guard hooks, keyboard navigation, focus restoration, reduced motion, resize preservation, accessible Retry, and Android-only offline entry are tested |
| Forui design system and Lucide icons | Not applicable | Piece 03 app-owned semantic tokens and Forui wrappers complete; bundled Lucide is isolated behind typed `AppIcons`, with package-boundary, semantics, target-size, disabled, focus, and RTL-mirroring tests |
| Timeline adapter and builders | Not applicable | Piece 15 selected the documented custom reversed-sliver adapter because Flyer 2.11.1 requires mutable controller-owned message state; app-owned immutable builders, anchors, jump, semantics, and bounded virtualization pass |
| User-facing maturity and disclosure | Not applicable | **Disclosure revision 7 (2026-08-24, ADR-056)**: revision 6 told every reader that group chats were switched off, which stopped being true the moment one ABI was measured. The point now carries both halves - ADR-036's disposable-state rule wherever the surface is available, and the fact that a phone whose processor has not been measured is withheld it instead - because a reader whose groups work needs the first and a reader whose groups are missing needs the second or will conclude the app is broken. ADR-052's mechanism did the rest unaided: the edit forced `since: 7`, which forced the revision, and `DisclosureChangeGate` re-presents once to a revision-5 or revision-6 reader with that single point badged. Re-delivering the written handover disclosure stays **release-blocking and has not happened**, now at revision 7, superseding the outstanding revision-6 obligation rather than adding to it. **Revision 6 (2026-08-24, ADR-055)**: the group point had been telling readers that group chats use experimental encryption and that an update can reset a group. With the group surface withheld that is not a caution but a false description of a feature the reader does not have, so it now says the feature is off and why, and that direct messages are unaffected. The point was deliberately **not** dropped: a reader who is not told will look for groups and conclude the application is broken. ADR-052's mechanism did the rest without anyone remembering to - the edit forced `since: 6`, which forced `DeploymentDisclosure.revision` to 6, and `DisclosureChangeGate` now re-presents the statement once to a revision-5 reader with that single point badged. Re-delivering the written handover disclosure stays **release-blocking and has not happened**, now at revision 6, superseding the outstanding revision-5 obligation rather than adding to it. **Revision 5 (2026-08-23, ADR-052)**: an audit of the composed artifact — not of these documents — found four claims false and two more read as promising more than the build delivers. False: the Settings notification row said an alert "can only reach you while this app is running", untrue since ADR-049 because the deferred catch-up and the sustained run both post alerts from isolates with no activity; the disclosure said search "do[es] nothing", untrue because the chat list filters on name and preview and in-conversation search reads that conversation's whole local history; the permanent "What it DOES protect" section promised "messages, files, and voice audio" in an artifact that sends no file and carries no audio; and the chat-list search hint promised "chats and messages on this device" for a box matching one preview line. Over-promising: the delivery point described delivery only as slow, while the server prunes undelivered envelopes on an operator retention timer clients are never told, so *late* and *never* were conflated — a new point `messagesExpireUnread` states it, and states that the client will not name what was lost, because `SyncProjection.isSecurityBlocked` is dead code and a one-to-one queue gap surfaces nowhere; and the same point omitted Data Saver, which blocks the catch-up's network on a metered connection. The permanent section now names **no feature at all**, enforced by test, because an enumeration goes stale every time the feature set moves; "social graph", "out of band" and "fingerprints" are replaced by the *Safety number* the app's own screen is titled. **The mechanism changed, not only the strings.** Each `DisclosurePoint` carries the revision its wording last moved at, `DeploymentDisclosure.revision` must equal the highest, and the pinned-text test fails on any edit — so an edit forces a `since` bump and a `since` bump forces the revision, closing the hole that let revisions 2, 3 and 4 ship with nothing checking them. **The revision a user accepted is now durable**: one integer in the encrypted preference table, no timestamp and no identifier, never lowered, written by enrollment before the session opens, and read by `DisclosureChangeGate`, which wraps the routed child above the router so no route, deep link or notification tap reaches the application without passing it. A reader from revision 4 sees the statement again with the four moved points badged; a reader with no record — every recipient who enrolled before this — sees the whole statement with nothing badged. It fails open in one direction only: an unreadable preference row withholds the gate rather than the application. Re-delivering the written handover disclosure stays **release-blocking and has not happened**, now at revision 5 — it supersedes the outstanding revision-4 obligation rather than adding to it, and it is the only thing that reaches somebody who never installs the update; `deployment-and-release.md` step 8 is corrected too, having claimed "the same seven facts" while listing six. Language parity is now enforced catalogue-wide instead of by three hand-maintained key lists that a new English-only key passed. ADR-045 stands otherwise: one application-level word (Experimental), two feature labels that only read down from it, and one mandatory first-run disclosure inside the existing `EnrollmentPhase.securityNotice` gate; periodic re-consent stays rejected, on ADR-045's evidence and on Vance et al. 2025, which shows habituation generalising from this app's own routine notifications to warnings never seen — which is why the re-presentation is a full screen and the changed mark is a labelled badge rather than a colour. Not verified by any test: whether a reader understands the result. Covered by 22 architecture assertions, 18 widget tests, and 11 store/use-case tests |
| 34-screen inventory | Supporting APIs/primitives ready as above | Pieces 09–11 implement authentication/enrollment plus Contacts/New, Contact Profile, Edit Profile, and Safety Number; piece 15 adds Chats List, DM Chat, Saved Messages, pinned/forward/action sheets, and all chat state surfaces; piece 18 adds Create Group, Group Chat, Group Info, Edit Group, and Add Members behind the production gate; later screens remain pending |
| English/Persian RTL | Not applicable | Piece 03 foundations, piece 11 contact/profile/safety screens, piece 15 Chats/DM/Saved coverage, and piece 18 narrow Persian group creation plus responsive group-chat/info coverage complete; later feature-screen verification remains pending |
| Accessibility/high contrast | Not applicable | Piece 18 extends the piece 15 screen-reader/live-state and 200% text foundation with semantic member actions, honest gated/read-only states, and narrow/wide group verification; later feature-flow audit remains pending |

## Platform delivery

| Capability | Backend | Flutter |
|---|---|---|
| Android encrypted database/Keystore | Not applicable | Piece 05 versioned Drift schema, SQLCipher database, Keystore AES-GCM wrapping with StrongBox/TEE preference, transactional repositories, bounded cleanup, and cryptographic wipe flows complete; physical-device process-death/Keystore matrix remains a release gate |
| Android normal resume/drain | Durable queue supports it | Piece 12 lifecycle/network resume, durable reconnect, socket-hint, and authoritative drain flow complete and **composed 2026-08-21 (ADR-047)**. Outbound traffic moves: growth of the durable outbox is what asks the supervisor for a cycle, so rows `SendConversationEvents` writes through `fanout.prepareAndQueue` are transmitted without further stimulus, and rows queued before a restart are transmitted when the next session starts. Two edges were corrected in the same work: an unreported platform lifecycle state at launch is no longer read as background, and every foreground transition re-reads connectivity |
| Android background polling | Seven-day durable queue supports it | **Implemented 2026-08-21 (ADR-049)**, closing ADR-046 follow-up step 3 and replacing two of its mechanisms on evidence. A backgrounded application now catches up through one persisted periodic `JobScheduler` job — `setPeriodic` at `JobInfo.getMinPeriodMillis()`, `NETWORK_TYPE_ANY`, `setPersisted(true)` — behind the existing `AndroidPollingScheduler` port, with no Firebase and **no new dependency**: `JobInfo` is in the framework at `minSdk` 24 and `setPersisted` restores the job after a reboot, so `androidx.work` would only have added a Room database, a service and a boot receiver to an audited manifest. The artifact declares one `<service>`, unexported and bound with `BIND_JOB_SERVICE`, no receiver, no `android:process`, and one new normal permission (`RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`); `dataSync`, `remoteMessaging` and every foreground-service permission remain forbidden and their architecture tests are unchanged. Exactly one delivery owner runs at a time, arbitrated **in the process** rather than by ADR-046's durable Drift lease: the job service runs in the default process and the Flutter engine documents one Dart VM per process, so a wake-up goes to the isolate the user already has, a headless `FlutterEngine` starts only when none exists, a second tick during a run is dropped, and a foreground entry point asks for exclusive ownership before it opens storage or reads a token. **Corrected 2026-08-22 (ADR-050)**: as shipped on 2026-08-21 that last clause was untrue. `awaitExclusiveOwnership()` was called by `MessageDeliverySession.compose`, which is reached only after `AuthenticationController.restore()` - and that restore *is* a rotation of the shared refresh token, so the gate sat downstream of the damage it existed to prevent. The composition test asserting otherwise passed because its harness replaces the real `TokenCoordinator`. `bootstrap()` now asks before `ApplicationRuntime` is built; attaching a foreground engine asks an in-flight catch-up to stand down, which `DurableSyncEngine` reads between envelopes, pages and batches so the foreground waits for one unit of work rather than a whole drain; and `TokenCoordinator` tells a lost race apart from a real session ending by re-reading the shared durable row rather than its own cache, adopting what another owner wrote instead of signing the device out. Proved with two real isolates over one real shared store. The same work uncovered and fixed a pre-existing defect unrelated to concurrency: `account_session` and `account_identity` were upserted without `singleton_id`, which SQLite treats as a rowid alias and auto-assigns, so every write after the first threw `SqliteException(275)` - meaning no device could rotate its refresh token twice. A tick is acknowledged unconditionally, because a finished job lets the platform freeze the process and an unacknowledged tick is a drain stopped part-way. Arming moved off the lifecycle and onto the session, because registering a periodic job restarts its window. Both entry points compose through one `ApplicationRuntime`, so provisioned trust, the single `TokenCoordinator` and the environment-gated crypto core cannot be absent from the background path; the protected-storage and message-alert channels, previously registered only on `MainActivity`'s engine and therefore unreachable from a headless one, are now Context-bound with one implementation each. The headless run opens no socket and runs one `synchronize()` plus one alert reconciliation, and it can never spend ADR-048's single automatic permission prompt because it truthfully reports that nothing is in the foreground. Covered by 11 scheduler-adapter tests, 13 headless-decision tests, 12 architecture assertions and 3 new composition tests. **Open**: nothing about timing was observed — no device or emulator run was possible — so the tier table in ADR-049 is documentation, not measurement; whether a persisted job survives an in-place upgrade is not specified by the platform and is mitigated by re-arming on launch; the Samsung/Xiaomi/AOSP Doze, standby, reboot, force-stop and Data-Saver matrix is a release gate for any *claim* about timeliness. ADR-046's opt-in `specialUse` foreground service (Layer 2) shipped on 2026-08-22 under ADR-051 and has its own row below; the floor is unchanged by it, except that a user who enables it also lifts the standby-bucket ceiling recorded here, because the Doze exemption exempts an app from App Standby Bucket restrictions entirely |
| Android sustained delivery (opt-in) | Seven-day durable queue and the built floor support it | **Implemented 2026-08-22 (ADR-051)**, closing ADR-046 follow-up step 5 and amending two of its clauses on evidence. A user who turns it on from Settings gets a `specialUse` foreground service that keeps this process out of the cached state — a frozen app's TCP sockets are terminated by the system — so the delivery path already composed keeps its connection while nobody is looking. **Off by default and a complete state**: nothing runs, nothing is requested and nothing appears anywhere until an explicit choice, and turning it off deletes the durable row rather than writing `false`, so an installation that never enabled it and one that enabled and disabled it are indistinguishable on disk. **No dependency, no boot receiver**: the choice lives in the SQLCipher-encrypted preference table, so only a Dart isolate that has opened it knows whether there is anything to start, and the already-persisted periodic job is what restores the capability after a restart or an update — at the next tick, which is disclosed. Three permissions are declared, all normal protection level and all inert until the capability is on (`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE`, `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`); `dataSync`, `remoteMessaging`, `systemExempted`, exact alarms, SMS and foreign push all remain forbidden and their architecture assertions were narrowed to the *floor* deliberately and in place rather than deleted. `specialUse` is selected because it is accurate: it still carries no timeout, no runtime prerequisite and no `BOOT_COMPLETED` restriction at API 37, and its mandatory subtype property states the real justification in prose. One line of the delivery path changes — `SyncLifecycleSupervisor` takes a `BackgroundConnectionPolicy` that answers *no* for every composition until somebody turns this on — and one thing is added that the layer cannot be honest without: a four-minute keepalive on a held connection, because a socket a carrier's NAT dropped is never heard from again and must not sit open and believed-good behind a notice saying the app is kept open. ADR-050's arbitration is re-derived for a **third** owner rather than extended: the activity's isolate outranks the service's, both outrank a deferred catch-up, the lower two are asked to stand down through the same latched handshake, `awaitExclusiveOwnership` waits for both, and nothing about it is durable. Every precondition is re-read from the platform on every resume and at the end of every catch-up, and the same pass **stops** a running service whenever the arrangement is incomplete, so the permanent entry can never outlive what it indicates. The entry itself is `IMPORTANCE_LOW`, silent, `VISIBILITY_SECRET` (absent from a locked screen and from screen sharing), with no timestamp, badge, count, name or message, and its one reviewed localized sentence crosses the channel *with* the start so a service can never display text this project did not write. The alternative of **building nothing** was evaluated on the same footing and rejected. Covered by 16 use-case and store tests, 16 architecture assertions, 13 widget tests across both languages and directions, and 1 supervisor coexistence test. **Open**: nothing Android-side was observed — no device and no usable emulator, every installed AVD being a Play-Store image — so the service starting, the entry's appearance, `VISIBILITY_SECRET` on a real lock screen, the exemption dialog, Doze survival, the Task Manager entry, restart recovery, battery and data cost, and the one-looper arbitration are all documentation and source shape, not measurement. The manufacturer half is **unresolved**: Samsung publishes that sleeping apps have "Job, Alarm, and Foreground-service … restricted" and that One UI 6.0+ honours foreground services for apps targeting Android 14, which leaves roughly half this fleet by version share covered by no vendor statement; Xiaomi publishes nothing about foreground services at all. The Samsung/Xiaomi/AOSP matrix across Android 11–17, with and without the vendor exclusion and across a system update, is the validation that would close it. **Withheld 2026-08-23 (ADR-053)**: that matrix was never run, and validating what a repository already recorded as unvalidated found the sentence in `platform-android.md` calling it "a release validation gate for any *claim* about timeliness" was enforced by nothing, so the capability shipped anyway. It is now gated closed by `SustainedDeliveryGate`, a compile-time constant with an **empty evidence ledger**: beta and production resolve `withheld` — the Settings screen offers no switch, nothing is requested of the platform, no durable choice is written, no service starts, and a service an earlier build left running is stopped — while development resolves `measurementOnly` so the matrix can be run at all, release AOT included. Opening it needs seven records, one per mandatory cell, each passing `isAdmissible`: not emulated, a strict ISO date that survives a round trip, a committed run record, ≥ 24 holding hours, ≥ 20 timed deliveries, ≥ 3 repetitions. An inadmissible row is kept and simply does not count. Ten falsifiable criteria were fixed **before** anything was measured, including that intermittent is failure and that the platform behaving while the manufacturer does not is failure. Two fleet figures ADR-051 recorded are corrected on a 2026-08-23 re-read of Statcounter: Samsung and Xiaomi are **90% of the Android fleet**, not 77% of all mobile, and Android 13-or-earlier is **60%**, not "roughly half", so about 78% of the fleet is covered by no vendor statement. One user-facing claim is withdrawn — `sustainedWhatItDoes` promised delivery "within seconds" where nothing had been timed — and a test now fails on the phrase. **Measured: two AOSP emulator probes and nothing else.** Every observation surface works unrooted, and the two images differ by a factor of thirty in their Doze constants with `use_freezer` false at API 30 and true at API 35, so the procedure reads constants per device and whether the freezer exists on Android 11–12 is now an explicit question for two cells. **Open**: all seven cells. Blocked by there being no physical Android device of any kind here and, behind that, by `runSustainedDelivery` refusing anything short of a full device-bound session — which needs an operator-activated account, so hardware alone would not unblock it. Covered by 16 gate assertions plus `docs/sustained-delivery-validation.md` and `tool/measure_sustained_delivery.sh`. **First hardware probe 2026-08-23**: a Samsung Galaxy A56 (Android 16, One UI 8.5, retail build) was probed, not run — the `samsungAndroid14Plus` cell now has a device and still has no measurement, and the gate is unmoved. It established that the procedure runs unrooted on retail Samsung hardware including forced deep Doze; that the `ACTION_OPEN_CHECKABLE_LISTACTIVITY` intent ADR-051 shipped unverified does resolve on One UI 8.5; that this phone reaches deep Doze about **thirty times slower** than the API 35 emulator the earlier reasoning used (`inactive_to` 30 m against 1 m), so every emulator-derived duration would have been wrong by an order of magnitude; and that whether the cached-apps freezer is active on One UI 8.5 **cannot be read from any configuration surface**, which is the one behaviour the whole capability is justified by. Contact with hardware also exposed two defects in the instrument, both fixed: `probe` would have committed 446 lines of the owner's installed-app allowlist, and `watch` read a `frozen=` field that exists on none of the three devices — a column recorded at every sample and never measured |
| Android local notifications | No foreign push by design | **Implemented 2026-08-21 (ADR-048)**, closing ADR-046 follow-up step 2 and amending three of its details. One aggregate, sender-neutral notification — content is `New message` or `New messages` and nothing else, `VISIBILITY_PRIVATE` with a matching `setPublicVersion`, no timestamp, one frozen channel id, and a launcher-intent tap under `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` carrying no destination and no identifier. It is a *reconciliation* of committed rows rather than an emission from `PostInboxCommitWorkPort`, because that hook can announce but never withdraw; the trigger is a Drift table-update signal, which the pinned 2.34.2 source dispatches only after `COMMIT`. Idempotence is the durable boolean `messages.alerted` (schema 12), preserved across projector rebuilds by the same upsert mechanism that already preserves `starred`, spent after a successful post and never before, spent also for a deliberate suppression (muted, or the conversation on screen) and never for a platform refusal. `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is requested at point of use, only while foregrounded, and spent at most once automatically under two guards; Settings states the true platform answer and offers one action that asks Android and falls through to its settings screen. No dependency was added: every API comes from `androidx.core:core:1.16.0`, already declared for `FileProvider`. Covered by 29 policy tests, 8 store tests, 6 projector-seam tests, 11 channel tests, 8 composition tests, 10 widget tests and 7 architecture assertions. **Open**: the Kotlin half is unmeasured — no device or emulator run was possible — so lock-screen rendering, the status-bar icon, heads-up behaviour, channel vibration and the permission dialog are a release gate, not a claim; group messages produce no alert because the piece-18 projection sets no unread state; decrypted previews are not built |
| What the artifact links from outside | Not applicable | **Decided 2026-08-24 (ADR-054)**, from the integration points the delivery and notification code actually reaches rather than from a package list. Twelve points: nine are written against the Android framework, three adopt `androidx.core` (pinned **1.16.0** — 1.17.0 adds nothing used here and 1.18.0 requires `compileSdk` 36.1), and one adopts `connectivity_plus` (pinned **6.0.5** and frozen, because 7.1.0 and later declare `androidx.core:core:1.18.0` and would carry this project's own pin upwards through a plugin upgrade — found by attempting the upgrade, not by reasoning about it). The Android dependency set is **locked for the first time**: `android/app/gradle.lockfile` records 78 modules across the six configurations a built artifact resolves, in `LockMode.STRICT`, and a new transitive arrival now fails artifact resolution — demonstrated by adding one and reading the failure. Five things were found and fixed: `jni` **1.0.1 was retracted by its publisher** and `--enforce-lockfile` guaranteed it would be reinstalled forever (now 1.0.3/1.0.2, and the hand-written KGP workaround in `android/build.gradle.kts` is deleted because 1.0.2 reverts what it worked around); `flutter_chat_core`, `flutter_chat_ui`, `riverpod_annotation` and `riverpod_generator` were declared and imported by nothing, and removing them takes **18 packages** out of the resolved set including a `-dev` pre-release; seven direct dependencies were caret ranges rather than pins; `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` was in every artifact and justified nowhere, arriving from `connectivity_plus`; and `androidx.profileinstaller` merged an **exported** `ProfileInstallReceiver` with four intent filters into every build, now refused with `tools:node="remove"` after confirming from its own bytecode that the baseline profile is still written by `ProfileInstallerInitializer`. Evidence rather than assertion: 4,559 class files across the 51 distributed modules were scanned for network APIs and every hit read, and the shrunk `classes.dex` of a production release **references no `java.net`, `javax.net.ssl`, `android.net.http`, OkHttp, Retrofit, `DownloadManager` or Play Services type at all**. Licence obligations were **not being discharged** and now are, by `docs/third-party-notices.md` in the handover. Covered by 14 architecture assertions, three new packaged-artifact checks in `tool/verify_release_apk.sh`, and the Gradle lock. **Open**: `connectivity_plus` cannot be upgraded until `compileSdk` reaches 36.1; the `path_provider` → `jni`/`jni_flutter`/ReLinker chain that exists only to locate the database file is not re-decided (F1); there is no in-app notices surface (F2); and the native core's Rust and vendored C licences are not aggregated (F3) |

Production release stays unsigned and is verified as such in CI, including that its packaged native core does not export the beta MLS symbol. Upgrade continuity tier 1 passed on an API 35 emulator on 2026-08-19: version code 1 upgraded to 2 in place with no uninstall, `firstInstallTime` unchanged, and the same artifact re-signed with a different key was rejected. The real signing identity was created on 2026-08-19 and its certificate SHA-256 is recorded in `android/beta-release-identity.properties`; re-verified against the keystore on 2026-08-20 (subject `CN=dev.nimashadloo.chat.beta`, valid to 2054-01-04, fingerprint matching the recorded value exactly). The rooted file-survival tier and the manual account/group/history tier against a live backend remain to be run, and the off-site encrypted key backups required by `docs/release-signing.md` must exist before the first external install |

## Required spikes before broad implementation

- [x] Piece 07 shared Rust primitive core, stable native ABI, Android packaging,
  isolate lifecycle, redaction, malformed-input, boundary, and packaged-device smoke
  checks pass for the Android-only version-1 target.
- [x] Deterministic-CBOR application-event CDDL, encoders/decoders, and Android
  golden byte/error fixtures are generated from one versioned protocol package
  (Piece 14: unknown-kind structural validation, future-version opaque retention,
  native property/golden tests, and Android smoke fixture verified on 2026-07-30).
- [x] Piece 08 canonical device-signature encoders/verifiers reproduce every
  backend `cross_sig`, `master_sig`, `spk_sig`, and `pq_spk_sig` vector byte-for-byte,
  reject required mutations, and pass through the packaged Android FFI/isolate smoke
  test. No Dart encoder or Web/Wasm implementation was added.
- [ ] Android `mlkem_native` passes identical FIPS/PQXDH vectors; no educational or
  pure-Dart ML-KEM is present.
- [ ] Hybrid PQXDH/Double Ratchet composition is independently reviewed.
- [ ] Piece 19 Phase-A production prerequisites pass. The former combined
  specification/identifier prerequisite is now two separately evidenced rows, because the
  primitive mapping and the MLS suite value sit in different registries with different
  owners, registration policies, and completion paths. As rechecked against primary
  sources on 2026-08-16, all five remain blocked. (1) The primitive mapping is blocked on
  one identifier of five: hybrid KEM `0x647A` is assigned in the IANA HPKE KEM registry
  (last updated 2026-04-16) but its only reference there is
  `draft-connolly-cfrg-xwing-kem-06`, a superseded Independent-stream draft now at `-10`
  and expiring 2026-09-03, while KDF `0x0002`, AEAD `0x0002`, hash SHA-384, and signature
  `ed25519` `0x0807` already rest on published standards. (2) The MLS suite identifier is
  blocked outright: `draft-ietf-mls-pq-ciphersuites-06` is an expiring Internet-Draft that
  the working group has already flagged as needing another revision, its IANA
  Considerations touch only the MLS Cipher Suites registry, and `TBD2` has no assignment
  there (that registry, last updated 2025-11-17, still holds only RFC 9420
  `0x0001`-`0x0007`, GREASE, and Private Use). (3) OpenMLS 0.8.1 stable and 0.9.0-rc.2
  still document only the three classical suites and their *released* post-quantum work
  targets X-Wing rather than the selected mapping — corrected 2026-08-18: OpenMLS's
  unreleased `main` branch does now implement the selected mapping exactly, at provisional
  code point `0x004E` behind a cargo feature, which changes the gap from a mapping gap to a
  release-and-registry gap without changing the result, (4) the MLS Working Group vector repository
  still publishes only classical fixtures, and (5) no qualified independent reviewer is
  retained. Draft-06 still defines `TBD2` with the exact recorded primitive mapping, so no
  suite/ADR stop-and-decide is triggered. Separately re-verified on 2026-08-17 against the
  pinned vendored crate sources and the X-Wing draft text: the closed beta implements
  `TBD2`'s signature, AEAD, KDF, and hash choices but not its KEM `0x647a`, so beta groups
  are not `TBD2`-conformant and are not `TBD2` interoperability evidence. The divergence is
  now recorded as a complete ten-row set (D1-D10) with per-row file-and-line evidence, and
  **ADR-040 resolves that the beta KEM is not changed**: the pinned `mls-rs` crypto crates
  are already the newest published versions so no maintained fix exists, no maintained
  provider implements `TBD2` at all, and supplying a conformant KEM through `mls-rs`'s
  public extension points would be a project-local cryptographic fork because
  `AwsLcCipherSuite` cannot be re-parameterized. The per-identifier registry evidence and
  every evidence table are in `docs/mls-profile.md`; production has seven mandatory gates,
  and ADR-040 opens none of them. Web support remains post-v1.
- [x] Piece 10 first/later-device two-phase enrollment is crash-safe and resumable;
  registration response loss never causes a blind duplicate; recoverable unsigned
  orphans are adopted or revoked; every intermediate state remains withheld through the
  signed device-log append and mandatory notice. Rust backup/recovery vectors, Android
  encrypted persistence/process-death tests, contract fixtures, UI tests, Clippy,
  analyze, and the Android build were verified on 2026-07-28.
- [x] Piece 11 activated directory/cache, authenticated-profile presentation gate,
  peer identity/device/prekey/log verification, exact-master SAS/QR, explicit
  user-signing attestation, persistent key-change/fork blocking, and localized
  contact/profile/safety screens pass malicious-server, pagination, cache,
  profile-authentication, accessibility, RTL, locked Rust/Clippy, analyze, widget,
  and three-ABI Android APK build gates. The profile transport fake is
  development-only and encrypted device-log gossip remains a later messaging task.
- [x] Piece 12 deterministic 513-target fan-out, exact-ciphertext ambiguous retry,
  durable REST drain/ack paging, opaque event deduplication, contiguous checkpointing,
  stale-device invalidation/refresh, full-jitter retry state, queue-gap MLS blocking,
  lifecycle/network/socket-close handling, offline restart, bounded queues, transaction
  fault injection, and redaction pass the full Flutter suite, fatal analysis,
  development/production Android APK builds, and preserved fail-closed Web build on
  2026-07-29. Piece 13 pairwise crypto and piece 14 application-domain integration
  now build on this durable foundation; concrete Android WorkManager registration/
  Doze validation remains pending.
- [x] Piece 14 deterministic-CBOR application events, typed conversation/message
  projections, authorization and tombstone rules, duplicate/replay/counter conflict
  handling, unsupported-event retention, receipt/typing/presence semantics, drafts,
  unread/mute/Saved Messages behavior, event-order permutations, transaction-failure
  injection, redaction, strict Rust/Clippy, full Flutter tests/analyze, three-ABI
  native packaging, and development Android APK/integration fixture builds verified
  on 2026-07-30. Piece 15 now supplies the final direct-message and Saved Messages
  interface.
- [x] Piece 15 production Chats List, DM Chat, Saved Messages, composer,
  reply/edit/pin/forward/delete/reaction/star/retry actions, explicit
  local-only/queued/encrypting/sending/accepted/delivered/read/failed states,
  fail-closed identity/device/log-fork/PQ composer gates, local conversation pin/unread
  projections and migration, and the app-owned timeline adapter pass full Flutter
  tests/analyze, responsive English/Persian goldens, keyboard/screen-reader semantics,
  dynamic-size/upward-pagination anchors, and the 50,000-message bounded-widget fixture
  plus development and production Android APK builds on 2026-07-30.
- [x] Piece 18 group domain, deterministic control projection, role authorization,
  invite/remove/leave and metadata/history policies, membership/conflict/quarantine
  projections, atomic Drift state/outbound boundaries, and responsive localized group
  screens pass authorization/state-machine/property/concurrency/fault tests, the full
  Flutter suite, fatal analysis, and development/production Android APK builds on
  2026-08-02. Development uses an explicitly non-cryptographic in-memory preview;
  production is compile-time fail-closed with no KeyPackage, suite ID, or group
  ciphertext path. All cryptographic production enablement remains piece 19.
- [ ] Piece 19 real closed-beta PQ MLS implementation is complete and production-ready.
  The dark implementation currently uses locked maintained `mls-rs 0.55.2` and
  `mls-rs-crypto-awslc 0.25.0` with the draft-06 candidate's symmetric and signature
  mapping over that provider's own pre-standard hybrid KEM — not draft-06's KEM `0x647a`,
  as recorded in `docs/mls-profile.md` — and Private Use identifier `0xFE4C`; implements
  authenticated BasicCredential/device proof binding,
  KeyPackage maintenance and last-resort separation, create/Welcome/Proposal/Commit/
  PrivateMessage processing, signed deterministic controls, later-member authenticated
  transcript replay, member add/remove, epoch/exporter state, opaque state-format
  versioning, and durable per-recipient pairwise fan-out through the piece-18 atomic CAS
  boundary. Transport v3 and schema v11 reject insufficient v2 transcript state rather
  than silently migrating it. The production fail-closed audit is covered by
  five `test/architecture/group_production_gate_test.dart` assertions, including the
  fully composed port that the use cases and sync engine actually consume, the closed
  KeyPackage-maintenance path, and every `GroupMlsCryptoPort` method on the unsupported
  adapter. The Windows host toolchain carries the MSVC C++ build tools, LLVM, NASM, and
  Ninja that the pinned `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` host requires, so the **entire** Rust
  validation stack executes. Verified on 2026-08-16: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`,
  `cargo test --locked` (49), `cargo test --locked --all-features` (60, including the
  `mls_beta` suite), `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`,
  `dart format --set-exit-if-changed lib test` (310 files, 0 changed),
  `flutter analyze --fatal-infos` (no issues), the full Flutter suite (403 tests), and
  `flutter build apk --release --flavor production`. Packaged Android builds of **both**
  the foundation and beta profiles cover all three ABIs (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86_64)
  with the export allowlist, 16 KiB alignment, and static-libsodium checks. Artifact-level
  fail-closed evidence: `llvm-nm -D --defined-only` on the native libraries extracted from
  the built **production release APK** reports exactly the 15-symbol foundation allowlist
  on every ABI and zero `cp_crypto_v1_beta_mls_operation` symbols, which exist only in the
  separate `beta` artifact, so a production build contains no PQ MLS code path at all.
  ADR-041 canonical fork convergence (superseding ADR-038) and ADR-039
  two-phase leave are both implemented and tested. ADR-040 (2026-08-17) keeps this KEM
  mapping unchanged, so no beta state, sealed snapshot, KeyPackage, or group is
  reinitialized by that decision; it also records what a later KEM change would cost.
  The divergent hybrid KEM and its HPKE integration now carry construction-level
  known-answer coverage (`vectors/beta-hybrid-kem-project-kats.json`,
  `src/beta_kem_vectors.rs`, 10 tests): exact `kem_derive` bytes, a deterministic
  encapsulation, key schedule, ciphertext and exporter output, and probes that
  demonstrate D1-D4 and D8 by computation. **Those vectors are project-generated and are
  not external conformance evidence** — official construction vectors do not exist for
  this construction and cannot, because it is not a published one — so they close no gate
  and do not advance the upstream-vector prerequisite. They found no mismatch: the
  implementation performs exactly the construction D1-D10 describe. The beta group
  operations additionally carry protocol-level vectors written in the MLS working group's
  published vector schema (`vectors/mls-beta-upstream-schema/`, `src/beta_mls_vectors.rs`,
  10 tests plus an `#[ignore]`d generator): Welcome, Passive Client Scenarios, and Vector
  Deserialization, with round trips that rejoin from the recorded `Welcome` and reproduce
  every epoch authenticator, and negative tests that keep those round trips from passing
  vacuously. The other eleven categories are skipped because the constructions they vector
  are `pub(crate)` inside `mls-rs`, or — for Messages — cannot be fully populated at all.
  **The schema is upstream; the values are not.** They are project-generated, are not
  external interoperability evidence, close no gate, and do not advance the upstream-vector
  prerequisite. Cross-implementation interoperability against a second, independent MLS
  implementation was attempted on 2026-08-18 and is **externally blocked**; no harness was
  built. All eleven implementations on the MLS working group's list fail the same
  requirement — the beta hybrid KEM is not a published construction, so it has no
  specification, no IANA code point, and exactly one implementation in existence, which is
  the `mls-rs` crate this project already depends on. ts-mls is configurable on five of the
  six requirements (arbitrary ciphersuite identifier, HKDF-SHA384, AES-256-GCM, SHA-384,
  Ed25519) and fails only on the KEM; every other candidate fails on the identifier or on
  ML-KEM support as well. The blocker is structural rather than scheduling: it clears only
  on the same upstream event ADR-040 names as its reversal trigger. Two findings were
  recorded rather than acted on — OpenMLS's unreleased `main` now implements `TBD2`'s exact
  five-primitive mapping at provisional code point `0x004E`, which **corrects** this
  document's and `docs/mls-profile.md`'s prior statement that OpenMLS had the right KEM on
  the wrong AEAD/KDF/hash; and OpenMLS and MLSpp have chosen two mutually incompatible
  provisional code points (`0x004E` and `0x0008`) for that one suite, which is direct
  evidence that no provisional value may be adopted in place of the IANA assignment. Full
  per-candidate gaps are in `docs/mls-profile.md`, "Cross-implementation interoperability
  determination". Remaining blockers are the full
  queue-gap remove/re-add/history matrix, upstream/project interoperability and
  bucket/backend contract execution against a running backend, multi-device and
  process-death/fault matrices on real hardware, state-format migration fuzzing, and
  independent cryptographic review. Device-local crash and transaction-failure
  injection over the piece-18 CAS boundary and the commit-to-network leg is done as of
  2026-08-18: 39 Dart tests across
  `test/features/groups/infrastructure/group_commit_boundary_injection_test.dart`,
  `test/features/groups/application/group_outbound_interruption_test.dart`, and
  `test/features/synchronization/group_inbox_crash_injection_test.dart`, using a
  temporary SQLite `RAISE(ABORT)` trigger per failure point and a reopened file-backed
  database for process death. It found and fixed a per-recipient logical send identity
  collision that made closed-beta groups of three or more members permanently
  untransmittable, a head-of-line stall in outbound dispatch, and a missing
  outbound-direction check in the three locally originated use cases
  (`docs/mls-profile.md`). This runs on the host VM against SQLite and the development
  MLS port; it does not substitute for the on-hardware matrix above. Input-boundary fuzzing of the beta MLS operation is
  done: twelve targets over every relay-reachable decoder, run on 2026-08-18, which found
  and fixed one non-canonical MLS object acceptance (`docs/mls-profile.md`,
  `native/crypto_core/fuzz/README.md`). The material an independent assessor needs is now
  assembled in `docs/mls-beta-review-readiness.md` (2026-08-18, revision `4e65eaf`): source
  baseline and pinned versions, in-scope claims and an explicit out-of-scope list, the full
  implementation inventory, the ten project-specific protocol inventions no external
  specification or vector can validate, the official-versus-project vector split, the
  adversarial state-machine question set, verified reproduction commands, and a
  finding-disposition template. **That packet is not a review, records no assessment, and
  closes no gate**; no reviewer is retained, and its own disposition table is empty.
  The engagement that would use that packet is prepared in
  `docs/independent-review-engagement.md` (2026-08-18): a qualification bar, a scope of work
  bounded to this implementation, the seven deliverables required before the review gate can
  close, and an evaluation of candidates and funding routes against primary sources.
  **That document retains nobody, names nobody as retained, and moves no gate**; retaining a
  reviewer, funding, the review, and closure of its findings are all external, and its
  engagement record is empty. Production still resolves the unsupported adapter,
  `GroupProductionGate` remains false, and production KeyPackage/group creation remains
  impossible.
- [x] Android reproduces the backend `cross_sig`, `master_sig`, `spk_sig`, and
  `pq_spk_sig` golden vectors, including optional fields and the 64-byte `ik_pub` layout
  (Piece 08: Rust vectors, strict Clippy, Flutter tests, three-ABI native package build,
  and Android FFI/isolate smoke test verified on 2026-07-28).
- [ ] Device-log chain verification, ETag refresh, encrypted head gossip, and fork alarms
  pass malicious-server tests.
- [ ] Android LiveKit Flutter E2EE meets the SFrame/media threat-model requirement.
- [x] Piece 05 Drift foundation: SQLCipher Android plus a preserved ciphertext-only Web
  schema,
  transactional migrations/repositories, constraints, reactive Riverpod projections,
  restart/privacy checks, and key-loss/tamper/logout/revocation wipe tests pass for the
  Android foundation. The Web persistence matrix is post-v1.
- [x] Piece 06 networking foundation: one bounded typed Dio client, contract DTO
  boundaries, safe replay/cancellation/timeout policy, payload-free diagnostics,
  proactive single-flight token rotation, and authenticated native Android WebSocket
  gateway pass mock-adapter, race, size, redaction, and close-code tests.
- [x] Piece 15 timeline builders pass long-history, upward pagination, dynamic row/media
  sizing, jump, mixed RTL/LTR, accessibility, keyboard, high-contrast, large-text, and
  reduced-motion tests. The Flyer 2.11.1 controller path did not meet the no-duplicate-
  state boundary, so only the adapter was replaced by the documented custom sliver.
- [ ] Android WorkManager polling is tested under Doze/standby/force-stop; only active
  voice uses a foreground service.
- [ ] Private CA/SPKI behavior works in Android staging. Strict WebSocket origin behavior
  is post-v1 Web work.
- [ ] Final product name/logo/app icon replace the neutral placeholder and pass light,
  dark, small-size, contrast, and Android asset review before release.

## Production completion gates

- [ ] Every pending row above is implemented or explicitly removed by an approved ADR.
- [ ] Backend contract suite passes against production-equivalent infrastructure.
- [ ] Full multi-device Android E2E matrix passes.
- [ ] Offline/international-disconnection rehearsal passes with zero foreign requests.
- [ ] Accessibility, RTL, performance, migration, battery, and voice gates pass.
- [ ] Independent security review is complete and blocking findings are closed.
- [ ] Reproducible artifacts, SBOM, signatures, hashes, update, and rollback runbooks are
  archived.

## Post-v1 Web backlog

The following remain intentionally outside the version-1 release: browser encrypted
storage compatibility, WebSocket lifecycle, shared Rust Wasm/worker packaging, browser
crypto vectors, Web E2EE media, browser E2E, CSP/SRI/headers, and self-hosted Web
distribution. They remain fail-closed and must be reopened by an explicit ADR before
being treated as release work.
