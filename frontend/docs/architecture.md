# Architecture

## Decision

Use **Modular Feature-First Clean Architecture with an Offline-First, Event-Driven
Core**.

The architecture separates product features from transport, storage, cryptography, and
platform code while forcing all durable state changes through one transactional data
path.

## Dependency rule

Dependencies point inward:

1. Presentation depends on application use cases and immutable view state.
2. Application use cases depend on domain types and ports.
3. Infrastructure implements ports for REST, WebSocket, database, crypto, files, audio,
   secure storage, background work, and clocks.
4. Domain and protocol code never import Flutter widgets, Dio, Drift, Forui, Flyer Chat,
   or platform plugins.

Cross-feature communication uses typed application commands/events, not direct provider
lookups or database writes.

## Runtime data flow

```text
REST / WebSocket / user action
             |
             v
   protocol validation + decryption
             |
             v
      one Drift transaction
             |
             +--> domain rows
             +--> inbox/outbox state
             +--> sync checkpoints
             |
             v
      Riverpod database streams
             |
             v
       app-owned UI widgets
             |
             +--> Forui shell/components
             +--> Flyer timeline builders
```

Widgets never merge optimistic, REST, and socket lists. A send first creates the logical
message and outbox work in one transaction. Network acceptance updates that work; receipt
events update delivery state. An incoming envelope is decrypted, validated, applied, and
recorded as processed before it is acknowledged.

## Feature boundaries

Feature modules correspond to product capabilities: bootstrap, authentication, devices,
contacts/profiles, conversations, messaging, groups, attachments, search, voice rooms,
identity recovery/device-to-device history transfer, settings, and shared shell/design
system.

Features own their use cases and presentation. Shared domain concepts live in narrowly
scoped core packages. A generic `utils` dumping ground is prohibited.

## Source layout and composition

The package must make product capabilities visible first and keep Clean Architecture
layers inside each capability:

```text
lib/
  app/                         root widget, bootstrap, config, routing, DI composition
  core/                        framework-free cross-feature policy contracts only
    application/              command, event, use-case, and port conventions
    domain/                   shared entity/value-object primitives
    protocol/                 framework-free protocol values and validation
    result/                   sealed result and safe failure classifications
  features/
    <feature>/
      domain/                 feature-owned entities, values, and rules
      application/
        use_cases/             commands/queries coordinating domain behavior
        ports/                 repository/gateway interfaces required by use cases
      infrastructure/         local, remote, crypto, and platform port adapters
      presentation/           Riverpod controllers, immutable state, and widgets
  shared/
    infrastructure/           only cross-feature technical adapters
    presentation/             app-owned reusable presentation primitives
  l10n/                       Flutter localization input/generated support files
  main*.dart                  environment entry points
```

Folders are created only when a numbered piece adds real code. `core` must not collect
feature business concepts, and `shared` must not become a generic dumping ground.
Feature-owned repository interfaces live in that feature's `application/ports`; their
Drift/Dio/platform implementations live in the same feature's `infrastructure` layer.
A feature cannot import another feature's infrastructure.

`lib/app/dependencies` is the Riverpod composition root and is the only place allowed
to select concrete adapters. Provider declarations are immutable descriptors;
ProviderScope owns instances and test overrides. The app root may import features and
infrastructure to compose them, but dependencies inside a feature point toward its
application and domain layers.

The offline-first path keeps a repository adapter as the single mutation boundary:
remote input and user commands are validated, applied to the local source of truth, and
then observed as immutable projections. Typed application events describe completed
facts; durable events are committed before projections publish them. Riverpod manages
lifecycle and observation but never owns the durable record.

Expected failures use the sealed `Result`/`Failure` model. Failures carry only stable
categories and reviewed reason codes, never raw backend messages or exception text.
Presentation maps those codes to localized copy. A source-boundary test guards core and
feature policy imports against Flutter, Dio, Drift, Forui, Flyer Chat, platform plugins,
and every other outer package. A source-layout test requires the four top-level
architecture boundaries and the recognized layer names inside every feature.

## State management

- Riverpod provides dependency injection, lifecycle, commands, and projections of Drift
  streams.
- Providers do not become an alternative database.
- Durable state is not kept only in a notifier.
- UI-only transient state such as focus, selection, and animation MAY stay in widgets or
  short-lived providers.
- Authentication and connection state are explicit state machines.

## UI boundary

Forui supplies tokens and application-shell primitives behind app-owned components.
Flyer Chat may supply the virtualized message surface only through the timeline adapter.
Custom builders own the exclusive visual design for bubbles, grouping, replies, status,
attachments, system events, and composer.

Flyer models/controllers are adapters, not domain models or the source of truth. If the
required pagination, anchoring, RTL, accessibility, or media performance spike fails,
only the timeline adapter is replaced with a custom sliver implementation.

Piece 15 exercised that replacement clause: the pinned Flyer 2.11.1 update path requires
a mutable `ChatController`, so the production `ChatTimelineAdapter` is an app-owned
reversed sliver with explicit reading-anchor restoration. Drift-backed projections
remain the source of truth. The adapter and all builders receive immutable view models
and emit typed intents; they cannot reach cryptography, APIs, Drift, or synchronization.

## Platform boundary

Version 1 implements the application ports on Android. The preserved Web adapter is
post-v1 and may later implement the same ports with different guarantees:

- Android uses encrypted SQLite and Android Keystore wrapping.
- A future Web client stores only ciphertext records persistently and keeps decrypted
  content in memory.
- Android uses active-page/socket delivery plus best-effort background polling for
  messaging; only an active voice session owns a foreground service.
- A future Web client synchronizes while a page is alive and drains the durable queue
  after resume.

No platform-specific conditional is allowed inside domain or protocol logic.

## Failure policy

- Expected failures are typed results, not strings parsed in widgets.
- Malformed or unauthenticated protocol input is quarantined and never partially applied.
- Unknown future event kinds are retained as unsupported records without crashing.
- Security failures fail closed.
- A queue `pruned_through` gap blocks potentially affected group sending until the
  device is removed and re-added with a fresh MLS Welcome.
- Network failures preserve outbox work and surface honest connection state.
