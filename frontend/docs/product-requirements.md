# Product requirements

## Product statement

Communication Platform is the working name for a private, self-hosted chat application
for a small circle of friends. It provides direct messages, invite-only groups, and
standalone voice rooms without a foreign runtime dependency. The final name and logo are
placeholders and do not block engineering.

## Supported platforms

- Android is the only version-1 production target.
- A Web client remains a post-v1 product direction; its existing design and foundation
  are retained for later work but are not shipped, tested, or release-gated in version 1.
- iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux applications are out of scope.
- The interface supports English and Persian from the first release, including RTL,
  mixed-direction message text, and localized dates.

## Release scope

The first production release includes the complete screen inventory in
[ui-specification.md](ui-specification.md): authentication, encryption onboarding, chat
list, search, contacts, DMs, groups, voice rooms, profiles and safety numbers, Saved
Messages, settings, linked devices, recovery, and all referenced dialogs and states.

The implementation may be delivered in vertical milestones, but an incomplete milestone
is not called the production release.

## Privacy invariants

- The server MUST never receive message, profile, group, room, attachment, or media
  plaintext or a content-encryption key.
- The client MUST NOT use FCM, APNs, foreign analytics, CDNs, remote fonts, remote
  scripts, or public connectivity probes.
- Search is local only.
- Login passwords and recovery secrets are distinct in storage, behavior, and wording.
- Cross-signing master keys are verified out of band before messaging; unsigned devices,
  master-key changes, and device-log forks fail closed.
- New direct-message sessions use hybrid X25519 + ML-KEM-768 without silent classical
  downgrade, and groups require the reviewed, production-approved suite defined by the
  [PQ MLS profile](mls-profile.md).
- Delete-for-everyone, ephemeral room text, and recovery limitations are described
  honestly and never as guarantees.
- Logs and diagnostics MUST exclude plaintext, identifiers, tokens, keys, ciphertext
  bodies, URLs carrying capabilities, and attachment metadata.

## Functional behavior

- The local database is the UI source of truth.
- Cached Android conversations remain readable offline; sends enter a durable outbox.
- A future Web client is primarily an online session. A suspended or closed tab is not
  presented as capable of reliable message delivery.
- A message received from REST and WebSocket is displayed once.
- Multi-device delivery includes every live peer device and the sender's other devices.
- The server stores no history. Message history remains on client devices and a new
  device receives it only through an encrypted transfer from an existing online device.
- The recovery backup restores cross-signing identity material, not message history,
  ratchets, MLS epochs, or authorization.
- A mailbox `pruned_through` gap is a blocking recovery state; potentially affected MLS
  memberships are removed and re-added with a fresh Welcome.
- Revoked devices lose tokens, queued content, local session access, and future group
  access.
- Voice is audio-only and uses the self-hosted LiveKit and TURN deployment.

## Non-functional requirements

- Smooth scrolling and stable anchoring with long histories.
- Responsive phone and tablet layouts for Android.
- Keyboard, pointer, touch, screen-reader, large-text, RTL, dark-mode, and high-contrast
  support.
- Deterministic recovery after process death at every send/receive transaction boundary.
- Reproducible builds with pinned dependencies and an offline-capable build cache.
- No release while a required security, protocol, accessibility, or migration gate is
  failing.

## Known platform limits

- Android background messaging is layered and honestly tiered (ADR-046, ADR-049, ADR-051).
  There is no foreign push and never will be. The mandatory floor — requiring nothing from
  the user — is one persisted periodic `JobScheduler` job at the platform's fifteen-minute
  minimum with a network constraint; it gives *eventual* delivery, and it gives **nothing**
  in the *rare* and *restricted* standby buckets, which is where Android 13+ places an
  application after eight days without user interaction. Above it, an opt-in `specialUse`
  foreground service is **built and withheld** (ADR-053): it would hold the connection,
  and what that is worth has never been measured on a single phone, so it is gated out of
  every artifact a user receives and the floor is the whole of what they get. If the
  matrix in [sustained-delivery-validation.md](sustained-delivery-validation.md) is run
  and passes, it becomes *near-real-time, best-effort* for a user who grants
  notifications and the battery-optimization exemption, and that exemption also lifts the
  standby-bucket ceiling underneath. It is not a guarantee: the platform
  may end it at any time, and on Samsung and Xiaomi the user must additionally exclude the
  application from the manufacturer's own app-sleeping — which this application cannot
  check and never claims to have checked. Delayed delivery is expected under Doze, standby,
  Data Saver, or OEM restrictions, and a force-stopped application is silent until it is
  opened again.
  A microphone foreground service is used only while voice audio is actively connected.
- Notifications are a projection of committed local state, never of a transport event, and
  reveal nothing but that something arrived. One alert, sender-neutral, announced when
  something unread and unannounced survives mute and the conversation on screen, and
  withdrawn when nothing does — including when the user reads on another device (ADR-048).
  Decrypted previews are not built, and an alert reaches the user only while the
  application's process is alive — which the deferred catch-up arranges periodically and
  sustained delivery arranges continuously while it is on. That is a statement about the
  *process*, and what the user is told must be a statement about their experience: alerts
  do reach a closed application, and the limit worth disclosing is that the phone decides
  when the application may next look (ADR-052).
- A future closed browser cannot maintain the application WebSocket. Messages remain in
  the backend's durable device queue until the user returns.
- A server able to replace a future web bundle can attack browser sessions. CSP and
  reproducible artifacts reduce risk but cannot give a future Web client the same trust
  boundary as a pinned native binary.
