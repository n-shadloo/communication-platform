# Frontend Codex instructions

## Scope

These instructions apply to everything under `frontend/`.

- Implement the Flutter client for Android and Web only.
- Treat every file under `backend/` as read-only. Backend code and documentation may be
  inspected, but MUST NOT be edited from a frontend implementation task.
- Work on one numbered piece from `docs/implementation-prompts.md` at a time. Do not
  begin later pieces merely because their interfaces are visible.

## Authority and required reading

Before changing code, read:

1. `docs/README.md`;
2. `docs/implementation-checklist.md`;
3. the documents named by the selected implementation prompt; and
4. the backend `API.md` files referenced by `docs/backend-api.md`, plus
   `backend/CLIENT_CONTRACT.md` and `backend/SECURITY.md` when security or protocol
   behavior is involved.

Backend documentation is authoritative for endpoints, scopes, limits, errors, and
server guarantees. Frontend documentation is authoritative for client architecture,
encrypted formats, UX, local state, and platform behavior within those guarantees. If
they conflict, stop implementation, identify the exact conflict, and do not invent an
endpoint, wire format, or weaker security behavior.

## External source policy

- When a required implementation detail is missing, ambiguous, or time-sensitive in
  the repository documentation, consult current official primary sources before making
  a decision. Do not guess.
- Prefer the Flutter and Dart documentation, the documentation/source repository for
  the exact pinned package version, Android developer documentation, browser-vendor or
  Web standards documentation, RFC Editor/IETF/IANA/NIST publications, and the official
  OpenMLS or LiveKit documentation/repositories as applicable.
- Blogs, tutorials, forums, search-result summaries, generated answers, and unofficial
  examples may help discovery but are never normative evidence. Trace important claims
  back to the primary source.
- External material does not override the authority rules above. If an official source
  conflicts with the backend contract or an accepted frontend decision, stop, cite the
  exact conflict, and request a documentation decision instead of silently changing the
  protocol or product behavior.
- For a security, interoperability, dependency, browser-compatibility, or other
  time-sensitive decision, record the source URL, relevant version or revision, and
  verification date in the completion report and update the owning frontend document
  when the result becomes a binding project decision.
- If authoritative information cannot be obtained, leave the affected behavior
  fail-closed or explicitly incomplete and report the missing evidence. Never fill the
  gap with a speculative implementation.

## Architecture

- Preserve Modular Feature-First Clean Architecture with an Offline-First,
  Event-Driven Core.
- Presentation depends on application use cases and immutable view state. Application
  code depends on domain types and ports. Infrastructure implements those ports.
- Domain and protocol code MUST NOT import Flutter widgets, Dio, Drift, Forui, Flyer
  Chat, or platform plugins.
- Drift is the durable source of truth. Riverpod provides dependency injection,
  lifecycle, commands, and projections of database streams; providers are not a second
  database.
- Dio owns REST transport through one reviewed client and token coordinator.
  `go_router` owns guarded/deep-linkable navigation.
- Forui stays behind app-owned components. Flyer Chat stays behind a timeline adapter;
  builders are presentation-only and never decrypt, call APIs, or write storage.
- Use Forui's bundled `FLucideIcons` only through the app-owned semantic `AppIcons`
  mapping. Do not import general-purpose icon packages or reference package icons
  directly in feature screens without an accepted ADR.
- Platform differences live behind ports/adapters. Do not scatter `kIsWeb` or platform
  checks through domain/application code.

## Security and privacy

- The server is an untrusted opaque relay for encrypted content. Perform every required
  signature, identity, device-log, version, replay, and authenticated-encryption check
  in the client.
- Dart may orchestrate cryptographic operations but MUST NOT implement cryptographic
  primitives or secret zeroization. Use the reviewed shared Rust core through FFI/Wasm.
- Never add classical-only fallback for PQXDH or PQ MLS, placeholder signatures,
  private-use production ciphersuite identifiers, TOFU messaging, TLS bypasses, or
  arbitrary server selection.
- Keep the PQ MLS production gates in `docs/mls-profile.md` closed until every condition
  is evidenced. Do not generate or upload production MLS KeyPackages before then.
- Never log plaintext, credentials, stable identifiers, keys, recovery secrets,
  ciphertext, attachment capabilities, or decoded tokens. Test redaction.
- Android and Web protection are different threat boundaries. Do not claim browser
  storage offers Android-equivalent secrecy.
- Preserve operation without international internet: no Google/Firebase dependency,
  CDN, remote font, telemetry, public connectivity probe, or other foreign runtime call.

## Implementation discipline

- Inspect the existing implementation and working tree before editing. Preserve user
  changes and do not rewrite unrelated files.
- Prefer small, typed, testable APIs and explicit state machines. Avoid speculative
  abstractions, global mutable state, generated-code edits, and placeholder TODO paths
  presented as complete behavior.
- Use pinned compatible dependencies. Do not replace an accepted dependency or ADR
  without documenting the reason and obtaining user approval when the decision changes.
- Error messages shown to users are reviewed/localized application strings, not raw
  backend detail.
- Update `docs/implementation-checklist.md` only for work actually completed and
  verified. Update other frontend docs when implementation establishes a binding detail.
- Do not create commits, push branches, or open pull requests unless the user asks.

## Verification

For every implementation piece, run the narrowest relevant tests plus all currently
available frontend-wide gates:

1. format changed Dart/Rust files;
2. `flutter analyze`;
3. Flutter unit/widget tests;
4. relevant Rust tests and Android/Web interoperability fixtures;
5. Web build/tests and Android build/tests when the piece affects those targets; and
6. `git diff --check` and a final scope review.

If a required tool or dependency is unavailable, report the exact unrun command and
reason. Never describe an unrun check as passing.

## Completion report

Finish each piece with:

- the implemented outcome;
- important files changed;
- tests/checks run and their results;
- remaining risks, gates, or follow-up work; and
- confirmation that no backend file was changed.
