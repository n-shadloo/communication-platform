# Client work

What the client developer owes, and nothing else. The server cannot change a file
under `frontend/`, so an obligation that lands there is recorded here instead.

This file routes; it never repeats. The contract the client implements is
[`backend/CLIENT_CONTRACT.md`](backend/CLIENT_CONTRACT.md), the observable changes
are in [`API_CHANGES.md`](API_CHANGES.md), and the endpoint reference is the per-app
`API.md` files with [`backend/openapi.json`](backend/openapi.json) beside them.

Each run of the server appends its section. Nothing is removed from this file except
by the developer who did the work.

## Remove the web target

The product is one Flutter application for Android
([ADR-0020](docs/architecture/decisions/0020-one-android-client-and-no-browser-surface.md)).
The server no longer carries a browser-only surface, so a web build of the client
cannot connect: the `/ws` gateway refuses a handshake that presents no
`Authorization: Bearer` header, and a browser cannot set one.

### The `/ws` handshake — this is the breaking one

The client already authenticates the native socket with the header, so the Android
build is unaffected. What must go is the second path beside it and the two close
codes it produced.

| Path | What is there |
|---|---|
| `frontend/lib/features/networking/infrastructure/realtime/socket_connector.dart` | `enum SocketAuthenticationMode { nativeBearerHeader, webFirstFrame }` and the `authenticationMode` getter on the connector interface. With one mode left, the enum and the getter have nothing to select |
| `frontend/lib/features/networking/infrastructure/realtime/dio_websocket_gateway.dart` | The `SocketAuthenticationMode.webFirstFrame` branch that sends the in-band `{"type": "auth", "access": …}` frame, and the close-code mapping for `4001` and `4403`, including the `code == 4001` recovery branch. Both codes are retired: authentication is now decided before the accept, so a refusal reaches the client as a failed upgrade (`403 Forbidden`) and never as a close frame |
| `frontend/lib/app/dependencies/networking_foundation.dart` | The comment describing the coordinator's `4001` refresh path |

The remaining behaviour a client needs is
[`backend/CLIENT_CONTRACT.md`](backend/CLIENT_CONTRACT.md) §O.

### The response headers the client may assert on

`X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy` and — on the attachment download —
`Content-Disposition` are no longer set. Any client test that asserts on one will
fail. `Cache-Control: no-store`, `Cache-Control: private, no-store` and
`X-Accel-Redirect` are unchanged. `API_CHANGES.md` § "The web target is gone" is the
full list.

### The web platform files

| Path | What is there |
|---|---|
| `frontend/web/` | The web application shell: `index.html`, `manifest.json`, `favicon.png`, `icons/`, and the two runtime assets the storage layer loads — `sqlite3.wasm` and `drift_worker.js` — plus `protected_storage.js` |
| `frontend/docs/platform-web.md` | The web platform note |

### The conditional-import stubs

Each of these five is an `export … if (dart.library.js_interop) …` trio: the
selector, the native implementation, the stub and the web implementation. With no web
target the selector and the stub have one implementation to choose between.

| Selector | Web implementation to remove |
|---|---|
| `frontend/lib/app/config/runtime_abi.dart` (with `runtime_abi_stub.dart`) | `frontend/lib/app/config/runtime_abi_web.dart` |
| `frontend/lib/features/local_storage/infrastructure/platform/platform_local_storage.dart` (with `platform_local_storage_stub.dart`) | `frontend/lib/features/local_storage/infrastructure/platform/platform_local_storage_web.dart` |
| `frontend/lib/features/networking/infrastructure/realtime/platform_socket_connector.dart` (with `platform_socket_connector_stub.dart`) | `frontend/lib/features/networking/infrastructure/realtime/platform_socket_connector_web.dart` |
| `frontend/lib/features/networking/infrastructure/tls/transport_security.dart` (with `transport_security_stub.dart`) | `frontend/lib/features/networking/infrastructure/tls/transport_security_web.dart` |
| `frontend/lib/shared/infrastructure/crypto/platform_crypto_core.dart` (with `platform_crypto_core_stub.dart`) | `frontend/lib/shared/infrastructure/crypto/platform_crypto_core_web.dart` |

### The build

| Path | What is there |
|---|---|
| `frontend/tool/ci.sh` | `flutter build web --release --target lib/main_production.dart` |
| `frontend/tool/ci.ps1` | The same build, as an `Invoke-CheckedCommand 'flutter' @('build', 'web', '--release', '--target', 'lib/main_production.dart')` |

### The wording

| Path | What is there |
|---|---|
| `frontend/README.md` | "Flutter client for Android, with a preserved post-v1 Web foundation", "Android and Web targets only" under **Toolchain**, the `flutter build web` line, the Web CA-install paragraph, and the Web step in the local-CI description |
| `frontend/pubspec.yaml` | `description: "Android and Web client foundation for Communication Platform."` |

`frontend/docs/implementation-checklist.md` carries the same "preserved post-v1 Web
scaffold" status in several rows. It is the client's live status document, so its
wording is the client developer's call — but it should stop describing a target the
server no longer serves.
