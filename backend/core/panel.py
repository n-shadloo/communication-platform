"""The shared parts of the admin panel: the base model admin, the audit writer,
the display helpers, and the dashboard.

The panel is a support surface for one operator, and the set of things it may show
is a security boundary rather than a convenience (ADR-0011). Two rules hold across
every page below:

* Nothing renders a ciphertext blob, a key, a signature, a password hash or a
  token. `Attachment.id` is a token — it is the bearer capability that fetches the
  bytes — so it never becomes a column, a link, a search field or an audit label.
* Every administrative act writes one `LogEntry` row for each object it touched,
  including the bulk actions Django itself would log nothing for.
