"""System-wide log-silence audit, driving ops/audit/log_silence.py.

The per-app suites spot-check their own paths; this pass runs one scripted sequence
across auth, devices, messaging, attachments and realtime, and asserts none
of the identifiers/blobs/tokens it generated reached any log line. The second test
proves the audit itself still has teeth, including against loggers that do not
propagate to root, the blind spot that would let a leak grade its own homework. The
third holds the pass to the whole route table, because a route the audit never calls
is a route it never cleared.
