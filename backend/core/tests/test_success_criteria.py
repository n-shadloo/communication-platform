"""Success-criteria aggregator.

Keeps the four headline invariants executable in one place, through the public
surface, so they cannot silently rot when the per-app suites are refactored:

1. no plaintext, no content key, no graph at rest (re-runs the seizure-guard audit);
2. a brand-new device restores the key backup, and no server-side history exists
   for it to restore — history is client-to-client (vault flow);
3. revoking a device cuts its access and destroys its server state (devices flow);
4. fan-out writes one independent row per recipient device and stores no sender
   (messaging proof).
