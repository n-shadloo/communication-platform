"""The shared parts of the panel, called directly.

`accounts/tests/test_admin.py` drives the pages an operator clicks;
`core/tests/test_panel_through_the_seam.py` drives one of them through the
middleware in front of Django. This file is the layer under both: the two label
formatters, the audit writer every action calls instead of trusting the framework,
the one-line role model, the deny-by-default permissions a model inherits by being
registered at all, and the dashboard's arithmetic — including the division it must
not perform.
