"""The per-app `API.md` files, held to the code and to the generated document.

These files are the human half of the contract: the retry semantics, the bucket
rules and the close codes are things a schema cannot carry, so a client author
reads them and nothing compares them to the routes. This file is that comparison.

The shape it reads is the shape the files already use.

- A route section is an `##` heading whose body carries a `**Method:**` line and
  a `**Path:**` line, each naming its values in backticks.
- A response is a `###` heading inside that section whose text names a status in
  backticks. A trailing parenthesised verb — `(PUT)` — restricts it to that
  method; without one it belongs to every method of the section.
- The throttle scope is a line beginning ``Scope `name` ``.
- The retry semantics of a route is a `**Retry semantics.**` paragraph.

Four statuses are not required per route, because a route inherits them from the
requirement it declares, from the request deadline and from the unhandled-failure
handler rather than from anything of its own: `core/API.md` carries their bodies
once for the whole surface. A route may still name one — `403 forbidden` is
route-specific — but may never name a status the code cannot answer.
