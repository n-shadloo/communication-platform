"""The Redis rate limiter.

Counters are volatile data, so they live in Redis and never on disk, and they
live outside the process so that raising `WEB_CONCURRENCY` cannot multiply the
effective limit by the worker count. The scope names and the `N/period` syntax are
the ones the deployment already holds, so no operator value is re-tuned.
