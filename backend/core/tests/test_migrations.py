"""The migration history: one file for each app, and a replay in both directions.

ADR-0009 regenerated the history, which is available exactly once — before the
first real user — and the precondition is that the deployment recreates the
database rather than migrating it. What that buys has to be proved rather than
assumed, so this file replays the whole history onto an empty database of its
own and then unapplies every app to zero.

The replay never touches the test database. `migrate <app> zero` drops tables,

    """The lock review, measured rather than argued.

    The migration's own SQL is run against a database migrated to exactly the state
    that precedes it, and `pg_locks` is read while the transaction still holds
    everything it took. Two things are asserted: no relation that already existed
    is locked harder than `BLOCKING_LOCKS` records, and nothing outside the set of
    relations this migration created or dropped is held at ACCESS EXCLUSIVE.

    What this catches in a migration somebody adds later: an `ALTER TABLE` that
    rewrites a populated table or sets a column NOT NULL without a validated
    constraint first, both of which take ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on a relation that
    already exists; a plain `CREATE INDEX` on one, which takes SHARE; and a new
    foreign key to a table that is not this migration's, which takes SHARE ROW
    EXCLUSIVE and would appear in the map the author has to write down.

    What it does not catch: how long any of them is held. A lock class is not a
    duration, and an ACCESS EXCLUSIVE on a table this migration created is free
    only because no other session can name that relation yet — the same statement
    against a populated table would be an outage. A drop is the case where the lock
    class alone decides nothing: `voicerooms.0002_delete_room` takes the strongest
    lock in the list on a relation every other session can name, and what makes it
    free is the release that removed every reader, not this measurement. It also
    measures nothing about migrations that cannot run inside a transaction; the one
    this project has is held by the test below.
