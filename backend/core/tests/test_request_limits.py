"""The pure-ASGI limits, driven directly.

One process on 1 GB of RAM has no headroom for an unbounded body or a request
that never ends, and no second host to fail over to. Each middleware is driven
here over `scope`, `receive` and `send`, because that is the layer it works at:
an oversized body has to be caught as the server delivers it, and a deadline has
to be able to answer before the response starts.
