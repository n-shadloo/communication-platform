"""The three deploy checks of `core/checks.py`, each driven onto both branches.

`core/tests/test_settings_posture.py` asks what `manage.py check --deploy` reports
under the settings this deployment actually runs; that is the posture. This file
asks whether each check can report anything at all — every `core.E…` id it can
raise, and the clean case beside it. A check that never fires is a check that
would not have caught the thing it was written for.

`INSTALLED_APPS` is patched onto the settings object rather than through
`override_settings`, which would call `apps.set_installed_apps` and import each
name: none of the four banned packages is installed, by design, so importing them
is exactly what must not happen here.
