# CLIENT_CONTRACT.md — What the Flutter client must implement

This backend is a blind relay: it stores and serves key material and ciphertext as
opaque bytes and **verifies none of it**. Every security property below therefore lives
in the client. This document is the binding list of those client-side halves, written
for the Flutter developer. The server-side halves are specified in `SECURITY.md` and
the per-app `API.md` files; the residual-risk statement (what none of this protects) is
`SECURITY.md` § "Residual risk".

A server-side sanity check (length, bucket, monotonic version) is never a security
control. If the client ever skips a verification because "the server already checks
that," the design has failed — the server is the adversary.

## A. Key generation and storage

- On first install: generate **master**, **self-signing**, and **user-signing** Ed25519
  keys. Private keys go to platform secure storage (Keychain/Keystore) and **never**
  leave the device except inside the recovery-protected key backup blob
  (`PUT /me/keybackup`).
- Per device: an Ed25519 device signing key, X25519 identity + prekeys, and ML-KEM-768
  prekeys.
- **`ik_pub` carries two of those keys in one field: exactly 64 bytes, the Ed25519
  device signing public key (bytes 0–31) then the X25519 identity public key (bytes
  32–63).** The Ed25519 half verifies `spk_sig` and `pq_spk_sig`; the X25519 half is the
  identity key in X3DH/PQXDH. The server treats the field as opaque bytes and enforces
  only a loose length range, so a peer whose `ik_pub` is not 64 bytes is malformed **to
  you** — reject it; nothing upstream will.
- **Libraries:** use `mlkem_native` (FFI to the formally-verified pq-code-package
  mlkem-native, FIPS 203) for ML-KEM. Use `cryptography` or `pinenacl` for
  Ed25519/X25519. **Do not** use pure-Dart ML-KEM implementations such as `kyber-py` or
  `mlkem` — they are explicitly educational and **not side-channel safe**.

## B. What the client signs

- The **self-signing key** signs the canonical device-bundle encoding (below).
- The **master key** signs the self-signing and user-signing public keys.
- The **user-signing key** signs another user's master key after out-of-band
  verification.
- **Device-log records** are hash-chained and signed by the self-signing key.

### The one encoding rule

Every signature below covers an ASCII **domain separator**, followed by the
length-prefixed concatenation of its fields: a **4-byte big-endian length before each
field**. The domain separator itself is not length-prefixed.

An **absent optional field is still emitted — a 4-byte zero length with no content.**
Never skip it. Skipping would let a bundle with PQ material and one without collide onto
the same signed bytes, so one `cross_sig` would verify for both.

**Golden vectors: `devices/vectors/vectors.json`.** Reproduce every `signed_bytes_hex`
byte for byte and verify every `signature_hex` before shipping. Do not treat the tables
below as sufficient on their own — a client that agrees with the prose but not with the
vectors cannot talk to the other platforms, and the symptom is silently unverifiable
devices.

### Canonical device-bundle encoding — `cross_sig`

Signed by the **self-signing key**. Domain separator `chat:v1:device-bundle`, then:

| # | Field | Encoding |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | `user_id` | 16 bytes, UUID raw |
| 2 | `device_id` | 16 bytes, UUID raw |
| 3 | `ik_pub` | raw bytes (the 64-byte pair, §A) |
| 4 | `spk_id` | 4 bytes, big-endian |
| 5 | `spk_pub` | raw bytes |
| 6 | `pq_spk_id` | 4 bytes, big-endian; zero-length field if absent |
| 7 | `pq_spk_pub` | raw bytes; zero-length field if absent |
| 8 | `registration_id` | 4 bytes, big-endian |
| 9 | `bundle_version` | 4 bytes, big-endian |

The encoding is deliberately self-contained: every signed key appears as its **bytes**,
never as an identifier to be resolved later.

### Canonical identity encoding — `master_sig`

Signed by the **master key**. Domain separator `chat:v1:cross-signing-keys`, then:

| # | Field | Encoding |
|---|-------|----------|
| 1 | `user_id` | 16 bytes, UUID raw |
| 2 | `self_signing_pub` | raw bytes |
| 3 | `user_signing_pub` | raw bytes |

`version` is **not** covered. It is the server's anti-accident monotonic check, and
signing it would imply the served version number carries a guarantee it does not — you
must detect identity changes by comparing `master_pub`, never by trusting `version`.

### Canonical prekey encodings — `spk_sig` and `pq_spk_sig`

Both signed by the **Ed25519 half of `ik_pub`** (bytes 0–31).

| Signature | Domain separator | Fields, in order |
|---|---|---|
| `spk_sig` | `chat:v1:signed-prekey` | `user_id` (16 B) · `spk_id` (4 B BE) · `spk_pub` (raw) |
| `pq_spk_sig` | `chat:v1:pq-signed-prekey` | `user_id` (16 B) · `pq_spk_id` (4 B BE) · `pq_spk_pub` (raw) |

The separate domains are what stop either signature being replayed as the other. Neither
covers `device_id`, deliberately: `device_id` does not exist until registration succeeds
and `spk_sig` is required at registration, so covering it would make the first
registration impossible. Nothing is lost — the device bundle above already binds
`spk_pub` and `pq_spk_pub` to a `device_id` under `cross_sig`, so **that** is the
signature you rely on to know a prekey belongs to the device serving it. Verify both.

## C. What the client verifies

- Before encrypting to, or accepting a message from, any peer device: verify the device
  bundle signature chains self-signing → master, and that the master key equals the one
  confirmed out-of-band. Reject otherwise.
- **Verify the key bytes, never a server-supplied identifier.** CVE-2022-39250
  (matrix-js-sdk cross-signing identity injection, CVSS 8.6) happened because checking
  and signing were two separate steps, letting a malicious homeserver substitute the key
  in between.
- On device-list fetch: verify the log head signature and that it **extends** the
  last-seen head. A fork is proof of server equivocation.

## D. Verification UX

- **SAS:** display a short emoji/number string derived from both parties' master keys;
  both users confirm out-of-band.
- **QR:** encode the master key fingerprint; scanning cross-signs.
- This is the **only** defense against first-contact MITM. It must be prominent, not
  buried.
- **Safety-number-style change warning:** if a contact's master key or a device's
  cross-signature changes, **block sending** and require re-verification.

## E. Behavior on verification failure

| Condition | Required behavior |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Unsigned / invalidly-signed device | Refuse to encrypt to it; show "unverified device — messages withheld" |
| Master key change | Block the conversation pending re-verification. Never silently re-trust. |
| Log fork detected | Global alert state; halt sensitive operations pending an out-of-band check |

## F. Sessions and groups

Every session — direct or group — is a pairwise PQXDH plus Double Ratchet session
between two devices. The server holds no group object, no roster, no epoch, and no
group key; a group exists only in its members' clients.

- **Session start.** Always use hybrid **X25519 + ML-KEM-768** (PQXDH-style), from the
  bundles `POST /users/{user_id}/keys/claim` serves. If a claimed bundle lacks PQ
  material, either refuse or clearly flag the session as classical-only. **Never
  silently downgrade.**
- **A group session is a set of pairwise sessions**: one between the sender's device
  and every live device of every member, and one with each of the sender's own other
  devices. There is no group endpoint and no group key material to upload; start each
  pairwise session from the same claimed bundles as a DM.
- **Prekey material.** The pools, caps, and replenishment are unchanged: at most 200
  classical and 100 ML-KEM one-time prekeys stored per device. Pairwise fan-out
  consumes one one-time prekey per session start, so replenish on the counts the
  server reports (`GET /me/devices/{device_id}/prekeys/count` and the response of
  `PUT /me/devices/{device_id}/prekeys`) before a pool empties.
- **Fan-out.** Encrypt the group message once per recipient device and send the copies
  with `POST /envelopes`, up to 256 items per call; a larger fan-out is several calls.
  Read `accepted`, `stale_devices` and `full_devices` from every response: drop a
  stale device from the group's session set and refresh that user's device list;
  keep a full device in the set and retry its items later, because it is live and
  its mailbox has merely reached its ceiling (`MAILBOX_MAX_BYTES`, default 32 MiB
  of undelivered bytes).
- **Queue, acknowledgement, and time to live.** The server stores one padded row per
  recipient device with a per-device `seq`, deletes the row on ack, and prunes an
  undelivered row after `ENVELOPE_TTL_DAYS` (default 7). The drain response carries
  `pruned_through` (§H).
- **Replay defence and ordering.** The server gives each mailbox a monotonic `seq`,
  delivers a row until it is acked, and never re-creates a deleted row. It adds
  nothing else: replay defence inside a session is your ratchet counter and a bounded
  skipped-key store, and any ordering across sessions is whatever the group protocol
  carries inside its ciphertext.
- **Device addition and removal** use the existing machinery: the device-list `ETag`,
  the client-signed device log (§J), `stale_devices`, and the revocation cascade. A
  member's new device joins the group when a member starts a pairwise session with
  it; a revoked device leaves the fan-out when it appears in `stale_devices`.
- **Member removal** is a client-side signed control event carried as an ordinary
  envelope. The sender stops fan-out to the removed member's devices. The server takes
  no part and learns nothing.

## G. History sync — changed; the server no longer stores history

- On new-device enrollment, transfer history **client-to-client**, encrypted and
  authorized by cross-signing, over the ordinary envelope endpoint. There is no server
  history API.
- A new device has **no history** until an existing device is online to send it.
- The key backup blob no longer contains a history key; it carries cross-signing private
  key material.

## H. Queue gap handling

- `GET /me/envelopes` returns `pruned_through`. If the client's last acked seq is
  **below** `pruned_through`, envelopes were lost to the `ENVELOPE_TTL_DAYS` cap, and
  the server cannot re-create them.
- A lost envelope may have carried a ratchet message or a group control event. Repair
  each affected pairwise session through its authenticated repair path, then ask a
  member for the current group control state. Client-to-client history transfer (§G)
  moves content, not ratchet state, so it is not the repair.
- Surface this to the user as a recoverable state, not a silent failure.

## I. Cross-signature freshness

- Rotating the signed prekey (`spk`) changes a signed field in the device bundle. The
  client **must** supply a fresh `cross_sig` and an incremented `bundle_version` in the
  same `PUT /me/devices/{id}/prekeys` call, or peers will correctly reject the device.

## J. Device-list log maintenance

- Append a signed record on every device-set change (add, remove, revoke) and on
  identity rotation, and on nothing else: the log holds at most
  `MAX_DEVICELOG_RECORDS` records (default 10 000), is never pruned, and refuses an
  append past the ceiling with `409 devicelog_limit`.
- Piggyback the latest known heads of contacts on ordinary E2EE messages; on receipt,
  compare against the local view and raise the fork alarm on mismatch.

## K. Padding

- Pad every ciphertext to the exact bucket lengths defined in `core/buckets.py` before
  upload. A non-bucket length is rejected with `400 bad_bucket`.

## L. Polling

- No foreign push (FCM/APNs) is available. Background polling only.

## M. Enrollment ordering (load-bearing — read before implementing registration)

`cross_sig` covers `device_id`, and **`device_id` does not exist until registration
succeeds**. No first call can carry a valid cross-signature, so registration **refuses**
`cross_sig`/`bundle_version` outright (`400`) rather than storing bytes that could only
be wrong, and the device is stored uncross-signed until you supply one. Both flows below
end with the same `PUT /me/devices/{id}/prekeys` call; until it lands, peers see
`cross_sig: null` and correctly withhold messages.

Do not work around this by sending a placeholder. A stored-then-corrected `cross_sig` is
a **cross-signature change** to any peer that polled in between, and §D requires them to
block the conversation and demand re-verification over it. Null is the state that means
"not yet"; there is no signature-shaped value that means the same.

**First device on a new account:**

1. `POST /auth/login` → register-scope token (10 min; its only power is step 2).
2. `POST /me/devices`, omitting `cross_sig`/`bundle_version` → `201` with the assigned
   `device_id` and a full-scope token pair.
3. `PUT /me/identity` — publish the cross-signing identity. Required before any *later*
   device can register, so do not defer it.
4. `PUT /me/devices/{device_id}/prekeys` with `cross_sig` (over the bundle for the
   `device_id` from step 2) + `bundle_version: 1`.
5. `PUT /me/keybackup` — the recovery-protected blob carrying the cross-signing private
   keys. Skipping this strands every future device: step 3 of the flow below has no other
   source for the self-signing key.
6. `POST /me/devicelog` — the first signed log record.

**Every later device:**

1. `POST /auth/login` → register-scope token.
2. `POST /me/devices`, omitting `cross_sig`/`bundle_version` → `201`, `device_id`,
   full-scope tokens. The account's identity must already be published or this is
   `400 {"code":"identity_required"}`.
3. `GET /me/keybackup` (needs the full scope from step 2) → unwrap with the user's
   recovery secret → the account's **self-signing private key**. This is the only path to
   it; a device that cannot unwrap the backup can never be cross-signed, and the user
   must verify it out-of-band from an existing device instead.
4. `PUT /me/devices/{device_id}/prekeys` with `cross_sig` + `bundle_version`.
5. `POST /me/devicelog` — append the device-set change.

In the `prekeys` call, sending only one of `cross_sig`/`bundle_version` is `400`: the
version is what tells peers which bundle the signature covers, so half a pair is
unusable. That, and the `identity_required` check, are completeness checks —
**not** security controls. A modified server would skip them, so peers must verify
regardless, and a device that never reaches step 4 must stay unverified in your UI
forever rather than being trusted on the server's word.

## N. Voice media keys

- Each participant generates its own **per-sender media key** and sends it to every
  other participant device over the pairwise session (§F), carried in volatile
  `signal` frames on `/ws`. The server, LiveKit, and coturn never hold a media key:
  the join token carries none, and the SFU forwards frames it cannot read.
- Drive distribution from the `room_presence` frames: a `join` names a device that
  needs every current sender's key before it hears anything, and a `leave` (explicit,
  or on disconnect) triggers rotation, so a participant who left keeps only the audio
  it already received.
- `signal` frames are volatile and never touch disk. A distribution missed during a
  reconnect is gone; ask the sender again rather than wait for it.

## O. The `/ws` handshake

- The token goes on the upgrade request, as `Authorization: Bearer <access token>`.
  There is one handshake path and this is it: the server refuses a handshake that
  carries no header, and there is no in-band authentication frame to fall back on.
- A refusal is decided **before** the accept, so it reaches you as a failed upgrade
  (`403 Forbidden`) and never as a close code. Read one as "refresh the access token
  and reconnect"; a handler that waits for a close code there will never fire.
- Treat a socket as a wake-up hint and never as the delivery contract. The durable
  queue is authoritative (§H), so reconnect with backoff and drain over REST rather
  than trusting a frame to arrive.
