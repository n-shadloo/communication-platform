"""No-graph proof for vault_keybackup, the vault's only remaining table.

A dump of the table shows only {user_id, blob, version, updated_date}: the blob is
an exact bucket length, updated_date is day-coarse, and the single user reference
is the backup's owner. No column links a second user, and no history table exists
in this app at all (vault/tests/test_no_history.py proves that removal).
