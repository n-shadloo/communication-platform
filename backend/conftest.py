class AsgiClient:
    """A synchronous facade over `httpx.AsyncClient` on the composed application.

    Synchronous on purpose. asgiref runs thread-sensitive work — which is every
    ORM unit of work — in the thread that called `async_to_sync`, so a request
    uses the test's own connection, sees the test's uncommitted rows, and lands
    in the counter `django_assert_num_queries` installed. An async test would
    push the ORM onto a second thread with a second connection and see none of
    that.

    Each call runs with the FastAPI lifespan entered. `ASGITransport` never
    enters it, and `async_to_sync` builds a fresh event loop for each call, so
    nothing the lifespan holds may outlive one call.

    `reraise` is the transport's own default and stays on: an unhandled failure
    reaching the test is what keeps a `500` from being mistaken for a passing
    request. Turn it off only to read the `500` body itself, which is the one
    thing the default hides.
