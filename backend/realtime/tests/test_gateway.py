"""The `Connection` object's own failure paths, which no socket driven end to end
reaches.

Everything a client can cause — a bad frame, a rate burst, a revocation, a
shutdown — is driven through the real ASGI application in the suites beside this
one, and that is where those belong. What is left here is what the transport
underneath can do to a connection that is behaving: refuse a second close, raise
out of a send, hand back a control event that is not a frame, or fill the one
buffer an outside writer fills. A `WebSocket` reached through the in-process
driver never does any of those, because the driver's send is a queue put and its
close is a message — so this file drives `Connection` against a transport of its
own, and asserts on the close code and the frames that transport received.
