"""The bus underneath the sockets: every failure is swallowed, and the reader
survives every message shape a live connection can hand it.

`test_bus_batching.py` measures what a fan-out costs and `test_recovery.py` drives
a real connection drop. What is left, and what this file covers, is the set of
branches no end-to-end socket reaches: a Redis that is not listening, a URL that
cannot be parsed, a client that refuses to close, a pubsub whose own commands
raise, and the four message shapes the reader must drop without stopping.

Every swallow is asserted through delivery rather than through the absence of a
traceback: the failing call, then the same call against a working bus, and a sink
that saw only the second. A swallow that also swallowed the working case would
pass a test that only checked for silence.
