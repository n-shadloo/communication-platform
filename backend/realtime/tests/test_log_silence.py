"""Nothing on the realtime path logs an identifier, a target, or a payload.

Like the messaging/devices suites, capture must bypass the configured ScrubFilter to
assert the code never emits an identifier in the first place. caplog is not enough:
the filter mutates records in place, so the console handler launders the message
before caplog's later-attached handler stores it, and a leak would grade its own
homework. So, like assertLogs, all root handlers are swapped out for the capture
window."""
