"""Pins the query count of every DB touch the gateway can make.

Each unit of work is measured as the synchronous function it is, not through the
`async` wrapper beside it: the async boundary is exercised by the live socket
tests, and `run_unit`'s `close_old_connections` bracket would sever this test's
own transaction under CONN_MAX_AGE=0 — Django closes a connection whose
autocommit flag disagrees with its settings, which inside pytest-django's atomic
block is every connection, and the reopen then fails with "Cannot open a new
connection in an atomic block".

The relay route is the exception, and it is measured through the composed
application, because it has no unit of work to measure: its own database cost is
zero and the claim is about the whole call."""
