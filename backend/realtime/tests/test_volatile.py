"""Signals relay between live sockets and leave zero trace: no new row in any table,
and no signal or presence table to write to.

The other half of the subject is the shape of the one thing this path carries. A
`signal` blob is standard base64 of exactly one `SIGNAL_BUCKETS` length, and a blob
outside that set is dropped in silence like every other malformed but well-typed
frame: no close, no error frame. It is a malformed-input guard and never a security
control — a modified server would relay anything at all — so what these tests hold
is the guard's boundary, not a promise about an attacker.
