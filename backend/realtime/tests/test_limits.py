"""Backpressure and protocol bounds: every violation is a clean 4008 close, never a
consumer crash.

Each bound is exercised at the value it admits as well as at the value past it.
A cap tested only from above passes just as well when it is off by one, and an
off-by-one here is either a client that cannot send its largest legal frame or a
budget that is one frame wider than the number the contract publishes.
