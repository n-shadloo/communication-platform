"""The whole HTTP surface of voice: `POST /api/v1/me/relay`.

A relay credential is computed, never stored: coturn under `use-auth-secret` keeps
no account state, so a username is an expiry and a nonce and the password is an
HMAC over it under a secret the two processes share. That shapes everything here.
There is no row to assert against, so what is asserted instead is that the answer
is the four documented fields, that the credential is the one coturn will
recompute, that the username carries nothing that identifies the caller, and that
neither the credential nor the secret reaches a table or a log line.
