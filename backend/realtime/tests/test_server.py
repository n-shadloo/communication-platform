"""What a real server does with the gateway, as against what the application says.

Every other suite here drives the ASGI application directly, which is where the
close codes live and where the frame protocol is decided. Two lines of
`realtime/API.md` are not the application's to keep, though, and only a server
can settle them:

- Every refusal is decided before the accept, so it is a `websocket.close` at the
  ASGI layer — but a server has no accepted socket to send a close frame on. It
  answers the handshake with `403 Forbidden` instead. The documentation says so
  because of this test.
- `1012` on shutdown is uvicorn's, not this application's: uvicorn closes each
  live socket itself before the lifespan shutdown runs, so `gateway.drain` never
  sees them on the normal path.

The flags below are the ones `ops/systemd/chat.service` runs with, so a change to
either implementation is caught here rather than on the VPS.
