"""The database half of the gateway: the token check and the three writes.

Each unit of work is a module-level synchronous function that opens no
transaction of its own and never awaits, and each has a thin `async` wrapper that
runs it through `api/orm.py`. That is the same shape every FastAPI route uses,
for the same reason: the ORM is synchronous, and a call to it from the event loop
raises. Splitting the pair also keeps the unit measurable — `tests/
test_query_counts.py` counts the queries of the synchronous half directly, which
it cannot do through the wrapper, because the wrapper's connection bracket closes
the connection the test's own transaction holds.

    it commits (ADR-0017), and the device a send is delivering to is the device

    transaction, and because a websocket scope enters no `ThreadSensitiveContext`
    (ADR-0005) it waits on the one executor thread every socket in the worker
    shares — so one bind stalls every socket's ORM work. A row that already says
