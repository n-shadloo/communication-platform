"""The `/ws` gateway: one Starlette WebSocket route on the FastAPI application.

One socket carries envelope delivery and volatile device-to-device signals. The
wire contract is `realtime/API.md` and this module is the whole of its server
half; `realtime/bus.py` carries a frame between two sockets, wherever in the
process set they are.

A connection authenticates before it is accepted, so every accepted socket is
already bound to a device. It is then a receive loop and a send loop in one task
group, plus the watch that turns an out-of-band stop — a revocation, a slow
consumer — into a close code. Every task of the group dies with the first one that
raises, and the cleanup that follows runs on every exit path alike: the
unsubscription of its topic.

The gateway holds no presence (ADR-0022). A presence subscription is a contact
list the client declares to the server, and the server needs none of it: who is
in a conversation is the client's knowledge, and presence between its members is
client protocol carried over `signal` frames like every other announcement.

Nothing here is persisted and nothing here is logged. The database is reached only
through `api/orm.py`, on the thread the ORM owns, and Redis only through the async
client of `api/redis.py`, so no frame ever blocks the event loop.
