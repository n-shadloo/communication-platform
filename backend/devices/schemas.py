"""The inbound and outbound models of the devices surface, and its limits.

Every request model forbids an unknown field and runs in strict mode, so a typo,
an injected key, or a value of the wrong JSON type is a refusal rather than a
silently dropped or converted value.

Two decode mechanisms live here, because they answer with two different codes. A
public key or a signature decodes inside its own field, so a malformed one names
that field in an `invalid_request` body. An opaque blob decodes in a model-level
validator, so it runs only after every field has validated: `BadBucket` carries
its own code and echoes nothing, and a body that is also missing a required field
must answer `invalid_request` first.

**Nothing here is verified.** Every length bound is a malformed-input guard that
keeps a wrong-sized value out of a fixed-width column or away from an unbounded
decode. The signatures and the keys are stored and relayed as opaque bytes; only
peers can check them.
