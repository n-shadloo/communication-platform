"""What the device tables guarantee on their own, below every route.

Three kinds of promise live here rather than in the service layer, and a change to
`devices/models.py` is the only thing that can break them:

* the state a row is *born* in — a device that has never been cross-signed, whose
  tokens are generation 1 and whose mailbox counter is 0;
* the constraints that turn a malformed write into an error instead of a duplicate
  — `unique (device, key_id)` and `unique (user, seq)`;
* what a removal takes with it, since forward secrecy depends on a revoked or
  deleted device leaving no claimable key material behind.

The two `db_index=False` declarations are checked against the database's own index
list: the comment on each says the unique constraint already indexes the column as
its leading key, and a redundant B-tree maintained on every insert is exactly the
kind of thing that comes back by accident.
