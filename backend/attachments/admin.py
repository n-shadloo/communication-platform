"""The attachments page: who is using the disk, and how to free it.

`Attachment.id` is not an identifier, it is a capability: `GET
/api/v1/attachments/{id}` hands the bytes to any live token that presents it, and
the id is the only gate. ADR-0011 says the panel shows no token, so this page is
built so that the id never becomes visible text and never enters a URL:

* no id column, and `list_display_links = None`, so no row links anywhere;
* no change form at all — `has_view_permission` refuses an object — because that
  URL would *be* the capability, and would then sit in the address bar, the browser
  history and any bookmark;
* the audit row names the attachment by its uploader and its size, never by `str()`,
  which would be the id.

What survives is `LogEntry.object_id`, which Django's own contract requires. By the
time that row is written the row and its file are gone, so the value it holds is a
capability that opens nothing. `backend/SECURITY.md` records it with its retention.
