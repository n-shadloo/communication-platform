"""The one outbound model of the attachment surface.

Two fields leave this process for a stored blob, and the model is what holds the
line: the row also carries an uploader, and a response that named it would put an
account behind every capability. There is no inbound model — the upload body is
multipart, parsed under limits Pydantic has no say over — and that absence is
asserted here too, because a model added later would be a second parse of a body
this route deliberately reads once.
