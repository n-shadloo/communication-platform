"""The synchronous units of work behind the attachment routes, called directly.

Each function here is one transaction or one sweep, and what it leaves behind is a
row, a file, or a raised `ApiError`. Driving them without a request is what makes
the disk half observable at the point the unit commits it: the quota refusal and
the purge order are both about a file and a row that must never disagree, and a
`purge` that met an unreadable file has to keep sweeping.

The same paths as they look through the HTTP surface are in `test_attachments.py`
and `test_routes.py`.
