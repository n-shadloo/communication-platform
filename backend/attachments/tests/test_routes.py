"""What the two attachment routes do with a body, an id, or a disk they cannot use.

One rule holds across the whole surface: a refusal is the `{code, detail}`
envelope with the documented status, never a `500`, and never an echo of what the
client sent — not in the body, and not in a log line. The upload is the one
non-JSON body of this API, so its malformed class is a multipart matrix rather
than a JSON one, and the id of the download is a bare path segment that reaches
the database with no schema in front of it.

`transaction=True` because the ORM bracket of `api.orm.run_unit` closes the
connection around every unit of work, which under a wrapping test transaction
would sever the connection the test itself holds.
