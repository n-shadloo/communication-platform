"""`config/urls.py`: the whole of what the Django application routes.

Every route of this API is FastAPI's. Django is behind it for one thing — the
admin panel at an operator-chosen path — and this file is where that path is
read, where `DEBUG` decides whether the panel's own CSS is served, and where a
second URL added to the project would land.

`core/tests/test_route_table.py` proves the composed topology from outside, by
driving the stack. This proves the URLconf itself, including the branch that
process never takes: the suite runs under `DEBUG=True`, so the production shape
of `urlpatterns` exists nowhere in a normal run.
