"""Nothing the API layer refuses reaches a log line.

The per-app suites cover their own payloads; this one covers the layer in front of
all of them, which is where invariant 6 is easiest to break — every refusal here
holds a credential, an address, or a request path, and every one of them is
written by code that never sees a route.

The capture replaces every handler, so the configured `ScrubFilter` never runs on
what it collects. That is deliberate: the filter mutates records in place on the
console handler, so a capture behind it would grade the scrubber rather than the
code. The scrubber is a backstop; what these tests assert is that nothing is
emitted in the first place.
