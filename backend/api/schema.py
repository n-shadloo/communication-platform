"""The OpenAPI document of this surface, and what each route declares into it.

Every error body of this API is the envelope of `api/errors.py`. A route names
the codes it can answer; `errors()` groups them by status and gives each status
the envelope schema, so the generated document carries the same vocabulary
`core/API.md` publishes for the client rather than a bare list of numbers.

`core/tests/test_openapi.py` is the gate. FastAPI has no counterpart to a
generator warning: a route that declares nothing reaches the document as an
empty schema, in silence. That file walks the document instead and fails a route
whose declared set is missing what its own dependencies imply.
