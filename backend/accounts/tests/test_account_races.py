"""Two accounts writes that can arrive at once, driven from real threads.

`transaction=True` because the point is real committed transactions racing: both
guards here are database constraints — the unique index on the username and the
primary key of the profile row — and a wrapping test transaction would hide
exactly that.

The style is the one `devices/tests/test_claim_race.py` and
`devices/tests/test_device_limit_race.py` set: every thread opens its connection
before the barrier, every thread closes it after, and each race is followed by a
test that shows the obvious implementation would not have held.
