"""The panel suite.

The admin is a security boundary, not a convenience (ADR-0011): what it registers,
what it renders and what each action writes are the things this file pins. It
covers the whole panel rather than the accounts page alone, because the rules it
proves are panel-wide and a second copy of them in five files would drift.

Every assertion here is one this panel can fail. The exposure tests in particular
were written against a panel that leaked: `Attachment.id` is the bearer capability
that downloads the bytes, and the first draft put it in a link, a change-form URL
and a delete confirmation page. What the panel holds now is the precise property
those tests state, and nothing looser.
