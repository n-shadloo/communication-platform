"""Nothing on the account paths logs a name, a password, an identifier or a token.

accounts is the app that handles the two values a person types, so invariant 6 has
the most to lose here: a username in a log line is a directory at rest, and a
password in one is the account itself.

The capture replaces every handler, so the configured `ScrubFilter` never runs on
what it collects. That is deliberate, and it is why `caplog` is not used here: the
filter mutates the record in place on the console handler, so any capture that runs
after it grades the scrubber rather than the code. The scrubber is a backstop; what
these tests assert is that nothing is emitted in the first place, and
`core/tests/test_scrub.py` covers the filter itself.
